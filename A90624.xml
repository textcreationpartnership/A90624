            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Advertiſement to the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is Recorded of the moſt holy that when the cry of the ſin of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> came up unto him, he went down to ſee whether they had done altogether according to the cry thereof, before he executed judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon them; and this is written for our inſtruction, that where indictments are drawn up againſt perſons or things, we may not proceed to ſentence upon the charg, untill wee ſee the proof thereof.</p>
            <p>We are not ignorant of cries, even outcries, againſt the liberty of Prophſying we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend about, and we fear notwithſtanding our former and preſent defence, if the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion be moved about it, what evil hath it done? the anſwer will be returned unto it, away with it, cruciſie it. Our brethren are preparing Spirits unto this, while they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it an Idol, the City of <hi>Jericho</hi> which was not to be built, a Trojan horſe full of Error, nonſenſe and blaſphemy, A Pandoras box whence all ſorts of miſcheivous &amp; ſoulpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning opinions fly out, &amp;c. See their Epiſtles. And here ſuffer us a little to expoſtulate
<pb facs="tcp:116041:3"/>
with them; Is ordination indeed as a Venice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs that can hold no poyſon? are you not partial, who can finde Errors, Hereſies, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencyes among perſons not ordained, but among the ordayned <hi>omnia bene?</hi> Alas what learned non-ſenſe, amongſt many of them? what empty notions? What Aiery ſpeculations? how often are people ſerved with bones inſtead of bread? How oft have they froth for drink? They that condemn too much Lead in a window, becauſe it hinders light, might be offended with pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted glaſſe.</p>
            <p>We confeſſe and deny not, we have ſeen Theeves and murtherers, going out, and in, at this door (as alſo in the other way) who deſerve indeed that their mouthes ſhould be ſtopped; but their evil, flowes not from our principle, but from the abuſe thereof; not from the principle as ſtated by us, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> in his Epiſtle thinks it done very looſly, becauſe though we aſſert it inexpedient, miſcheivous, and uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to preach without approbation from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; yet we ſay (in ſome caſes for ought we know) it may be ſo done, <hi>Preacher Sent. pag.</hi> 20. wherein we might promiſe our ſelves fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour for them whoſe principle it is, that in ſome caſes it may be lawful to preach with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Ordination, Mr. <hi>Pool pag.</hi> 68. 102. If they put Ordination in the place of Aprobation, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:116041:3"/>
yet ſay, in ſome caſes a man may preach without ordination; where is the offence?</p>
            <p>But Dr. <hi>Collings</hi> doth judge that no rule of Regulation can, or will be fixed by us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this liberty, ſo that it differs not from li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſſe, but is a very ſtrumpet, harlot, Mother of abominations, &amp;c. We anſwer,</p>
            <p>1. If by this rule of Regulation he mean the form or patern to which all doctrine muſt conform, which therefore is called <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula regulans,</hi> the Rule is fixed. <hi>viz.</hi> the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures. 2. If he mean the meaſure or ſtandard for qualification, the Rule needs not be fixed by us; where it is fixed (as in Rules of examination unto Ordination) it is rarely obſerved, and a man may be qualified for one place or people, not for another.</p>
            <p>3. If he mean the order of reducement in caſe Error or hereſie be preached, or the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty any way abuſed, the Rule is fixed <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15, 16. The Church hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over preachers and over Paſtors, <hi>Coloſſ. 4. 17. 1 Corin. 5. 12. Rev. 2. ver. 2. Thou haſt tried them which ſay they are Apoſtles, and are not, and haſt found them lyers.</hi> That Church and the Angel thereof, are commended for trying of Preachers; Thoſe that may, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve, may approve where there is cauſe: here is a Scripture rule for approbation of Preachers, and that not ſo much as in order to Ordination.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:116041:4"/>
Courteous Reader, we deſire thee to take notice of theſe few following particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we do not repeat all the words of Dr. <hi>Collings</hi> or Mr. <hi>Pool,</hi> but what is moſt material, in their Arguments, which liberty they have taken to themſelves, in replying to us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That although we have cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that many Arguments in our former book, yet remain untouched, and ſome but ſlightly wounded, are buried alive, with too much of the duſt and aſhes of reproach caſt upon them; yet hoping and expecting that the determining Reader will examine and compare Arguments and anſwers impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we ſhall be ſilent.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That very many of Mr. <hi>Pools</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and replies, are drawn from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and that in matters wherein they acted as extraordinary Officers.</p>
            <p>Alſo neceſſity is often urged againſt us; whereas neceſſity cannot juſtly be pleaded to juſtifie actings, unleſs it be in natural duties; Their inſtance of the Shew-bread reacheth no further; it was a natural duty to eat that, for the preſervation of life: to kill a man in ſelf-defence is a natural duty, which may further anſwer what Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 102. about neceſſity; we ſay, to defend the life of a man, or to take away the life of a murderer, is not a peculiar
<pb facs="tcp:116041:4"/>
work to a Magiſtrate; but to command per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to the one and the other, is the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats work, and this a private man may not do in a caſe of neceſſity; and if they will grant preaching to be a natural duty, how can they deny gifted men liberty for doing of it?</p>
            <p n="4">4. That thou art to expect this the laſt thou ſhalt receive from us in this controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie we cannot abſolutely promiſe it, becauſe the righteous, and the wiſe, and their works are in the hand of God, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 1. but are very much inclined unto it, amongſt others, upon theſe grounds; becauſe we have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken fully to the matter in our former, and this book, and there is no end of words; neither do we love alwayes to be wading in a controverſie, which diverteth from more practical things at preſent, and at the laſt muſt be left to the Reader to judge; and we would not by multiplying replies, carry thee away from thoſe Arguments we uſed in the firſt Book, which they have left behind without any thingof anſwer offered to them, whereby it would come to paſſe, that the cauſe would appear more weak, when it wanteth no ſtrength to ſupport it. And as there is liberty of ſpirit or vanity, bewrayed even in the <hi>Drs.</hi> Title page ſo we meet with inſulting language here and there, in both their books; all which conſidered, we deſire thou wouldſt not think their books unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable,

               <hi>A Father may have ten daughters, and each daughter her family diſtinct, the Father hath power in each family, though the particular ſisters, or their o fficers not ſo, Nor are the arguments more cogent taken from baptiſm and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication;-Baptiſm makes not any one stand in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Church more then the Lords-Supper, nor is it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred that perſons may be members of the body, we know our brethren will not administer it to the heathens, or Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, but to perſons called from Idols,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>to members (in their ſenſe) of the viſible Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>We know our brethren qualified their Catholick notion with this terme [ſolemn] intending not admiſſion, in a general ſenſe, but ſolemn admiſſion, as the enlisting or enrolment of a ſoldier is his admiſſion into the Army.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>But its conſistency with their other principles we ſee not, If a ſoldier be caſheired, he is readmitted by a new enrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, If a member be excomunicate yet when abſolved he is not rebaptized; We need ſay no more to this argument here, having occaſion to meet it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> againe and to conſider the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whereon its built. We rest very confident that ſome Parent, Maſter, or neighbour, who through providence is inſtrumental to the converting of a ſinner, doth more to the entring a perſon into the body of Chriſt, then any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister ever did by Baptiſm, or can do.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Excomunication indeed ſeparateth, the perſon excomuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, from Relation to and communion with, the body from which he is cut off,</hi> 1 Cor. 55. 7. 13. <hi>But as a member forfeiting his freedom at</hi> London, <hi>is formerly deſfranchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed there, where he was actually a member, and conſequently incapacitated to claim the Priviledges which formerly he enjoyed by vertue of that freedom other where, though</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don <hi>and other Cities and Townes Corporate, make not one Corporation, So it is in this caſe.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N his firſt Chapter to <hi>pag.</hi> 10. He endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth to open the terms, Miniſter and Miniſtry, and to ſhew the ſignification of the Originall words whereby the the former is expreſſed, and all this to deny the name of Miniſter unto gifted men.</p>
               <p>To all which we ſhall ſay but this.</p>
               <p>The term is a Generical term divided.</p>

                  </hi> but from Miniſtering in the word.</p>
               <p>We grant it is an appropriated terme, and do uſe it according to its appropriation, it being uſual to ſay, There is the Miniſter of ſuch a place, ſpeaking
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:116041:18"/>
of one that ordinarily Preacheth there, whoſe Preaching and Miniſtering in the word, is the reaſon of the denomination, Preacher, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
               <p>We have proved that gifted men have a Divine allowance to Preach, and that may aptly denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate them Miniſters <hi>i. e.</hi> of the Goſpel, becauſe they Miniſter unto Chriſt therein.</p>
               <p>But if he liketh not to have them bear this name, let him call them (as the Apoſtle doth 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.) by the name of Prophets.</p>
               <p>In our Book we have this Poſition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Poſit.</hi> 1. That Office is not a relation to the work and employment of the Miniſtry as its Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relate.</p>
               <p>After ſome unbeſeeming Language he levelleth two Arguments againſt this Propoſition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 1. If the Office of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry either hath its whole being in <note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ind. Revind. Pag.</hi> 12.</note> relation to the work, or be any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way referred to the work, then the Office and employment according to Logick are relations.</p>
               <p>But the Office and work of the Miniſtry have at leaſt one of theſe references each to another. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Office is ſome way referred to employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo hath ſome relation to it; we expreſſely ſay, That Office is a relation which reſpects em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment as its end, <hi>Preacher ſent. p.</hi> 4. and Dr. <hi>Collings</hi> repeateth theſe words as ours, <hi>Vind.</hi> pag. 11. and therefore here he diſputes againſt what he knoweth his adverſaries do not ſay, which he would blame us for, <hi>Vind.</hi> pag. 25.</p>
               <p>If this whole Argument be granted, nothing is gained by it againſt the Propoſition, for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:116041:18"/>
is onely this, <hi>Ergo</hi> the office and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to Logick are relations; whereas if it had concluded the queſtion, it muſt have been, <hi>Ergo</hi> Office is a relation to the work and employment of the Miniſtry as its Correlate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. The Correlate to any relation is, that wherein the ſubject is termniated, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>in. Revi.</hi> But the office of the Miniſtry is terminated <hi>pag.</hi> 12. in the work; Therefore the work is its Correlate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. An illogicall argument<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in the <hi>major,</hi> the ſubject of the relation is remembred, in the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> it is forgotten, and the relation it ſelf put in the place thereof.</p>
               <p>If it were in form, it muſt run thus; The Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to any relation is that wherein the ſubject is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated: But the ſubject of office relation is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated in the worke. <hi>Ergo,</hi> work is the Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. If his <hi>major</hi> be underſtood univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>viz.</hi> That the correlate to any relation is any thing wherein the ſubject is any way terminated, we may fairely deny this without denying all Logick. If it be taken particularly, it is not concluſive againſt us; we grant that the Correlate to any relation is that wherein the ſubject is ſo terminated as the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or being of the relation is introduced by its termination; as a Father is ſo terminated in a Son or Child, that he hath his being as a Father in having a Son or Child, and therefore a Son or child is Correlate, &amp; ſo in other ſuch relations. But the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relate to any relation is not that wherein the ſubject is terminated as the end of the relation; for the ends cannot be attained until the relation it ſelf hath an actuall exiſtence, and exiſt it cannot without a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relate. As the relation of a Father is terminated in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:116041:19"/>
the worke of a Father as its end, yet there muſt be a Son or child in being before the doing of that work; and the ſame may be ſaid of other relations, as Maſter and ſervant, Husband and wife, &amp;c. and thus the work of the Miniſtry being the end of that relation, there muſt be a Correlate in being, before that worke can be performed, and ſo work cannot be the Correlate; If this will hold good in relations, <hi>ſecundum eſſe,</hi> that is enough in this matter to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence his argument to be falſe, for that runneth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, the Correlate to [any relation, &amp;c.] and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it doth not yet appear that officers are relations <hi>ſecundum dici.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. As to his <hi>Minor</hi> we ſay, The office of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry is not terminated in the work conſidered abſolutely, but reſpectively, as the office of the May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of <hi>Norwich</hi> is not terminated in the work of a Mayor or Magiſtracy abſolutely, and ſo for Juſtices of the peace or other civil officers, if they go out of the city, Corporation or county whereunto they are limited, they cannot act as officers, and therefore their office is terminated in their work in ſuch a place or amongſt ſuch a people. And thus the office of the Miniſtry is terminated, not in the work in general, but with reſpect and reference unto ſuch a people, or ſuch a Church, <hi>Relata ſunt aliorum. Dr. Collings</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth in a reply to our four arguments, which ſhews that worke cannot be the Correlate to the Office; In anſwer to the two firſt, he ſaith,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> 1. <hi>Officers are,</hi> Relata ſecundum dici, <hi>not</hi> Relata ſecundum eſſe, <hi>nominal relations, not thoſe that Logicians call real relations,</hi> Vind. Revind. pag. 14. 15. 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We ſuppoſe Dr. <hi>Collings</hi> is the firſt that hath ranked officers, (who are to be over others) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe that are <hi>Relata ſecundum dici;</hi> we
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:116041:19"/>
have not met with any Logicians that have done in before him, &amp; the Rules upon which our arguments are built, are known (by all that are acquainted with Logick) to be true in ſuch as are <hi>Relata ſecundum eſse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. Againſt its being a Nominall Relation we ſhall offer an argument or two.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. If the office of the Miniſtry hath no abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute being, nor doth appertain to any other predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment beſides that of Relation, then it is (according to Logicians) a relation <hi>ſecundum eſſe,</hi> or a real rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But the Office of the Miniſtry hath no abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute being, nor doth appertain to any other predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment beſides that of Relation; <hi>Ergo,</hi> The office of the Miniſtry, is (according to Logicians) a relation <hi>ſecundum eſse.</hi> The <hi>major</hi> none that is acquainted with Logick can deny.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> appeareth, becauſe there is no other predicament that it is reducible to; let him ſhew to which, if it may be referred.</p>
               <p>We yet adhere to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in this, and <hi>Seton</hi> who giving an inſtance of predicamental relation, giveth it in the office of Magiſtracy, &amp; we ſuppoſe the office of the Miniſtry is in the ſame predicament with that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. If officers <hi>qua</hi> officers have their whole being in reſpect and reference unto others, then office is a Relation <hi>ſecundum eſse,</hi> but officers <hi>qua</hi> offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers have their whole being in reſpect &amp; reference un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others, <hi>Ergo,</hi> office is a relation, <hi>ſecundum eſſe,</hi> The <hi>major</hi> he cannot deny, The <hi>Minor</hi> he excepteth againſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob. But the Eſſence of office lyeth not in its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, but in that authority wherewith the perſon is cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed by his ordination,</hi> Vind. Revind. pag. 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Authority hath no Cauſal influence into office, but floweth from it, and followeth after it; therefore the eſſence of Office doth not conſiſt in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:116041:20"/>
The <hi>London</hi> Miniſters ſay, Church Officers are the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the firſt recepticle, or ſubject of Church authority, <hi>Jus. Divin. Regim.</hi> pag. 163. If ſo, then officers are before authority, at leaſt <hi>priorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te nature,</hi> and then authority is but an adjunct, which though a neceſſary concequent, yet is no conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: conſider Maſter and Scholers, a Tutor &amp; pupils &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Anſ. 2 If this were true, then it were poſſible for a relation to hold, though every thing in the world ſhould ceaſe which it ſhould ſtand referred to: There might be a relation, and yet nothing be rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, or elſe ordination in ſuch a caſe muſt be loſt.</p>
               <p>It is not proved that a perſon can ſtand cloathed with the authority of the Miniſterial relation, if there be no Church that he ſtandeth related to.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A man is not actually an officer when he cannot do his Office, but the habit remaines,</hi> Vind. Revind. pag. 14.</p>
               <p>Anſ. <hi>Zabarel</hi> whom he mentionethis againſt him, who ſaith, <hi>Non eſt relatio niſi interea que ſunt actu, non eſt enim pater niſi qui actu filium habeat, quo fit ut ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per neceſſarium ſit uno relativorum exiſtente, alterum quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que exiſtere.</hi> Zab. <hi>de fac. an. cap.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>Conſider <hi>Job,</hi> to day he hath children, he is a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, conſider him to morrow, he hath no children, he is no Father when he hath none; it is poſſible he may afterward; ſhall we ſay therefore he is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentially, or habitually a father? His dividing an officer into actual and potential, is as the dividing <hi>Ens,</hi> into <hi>Ens &amp; non Ens.</hi> His inſtance about the Mayor of <hi>Norwich</hi> is nothing to his purpoſe; we grant that though he be ſick or in priſon, and ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not execute his Office, yet he is not only potentially but actually an officer ſtill.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe the City of <hi>Norwich</hi> ſhould either by
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:116041:20"/>
fire, or ſword, or famine, or any ſuch ſad provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ceaſe to exiſt, if the Mayor ſhould be left alive, we ask whither he could be deemed a Mayor or an Officer ſtill when there were no City of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi> exiſting to be the correlate to him as a Relate? The like we ſay in the caſe in hand, how can a man remain in the Office of the Miniſtry, if there be no Church as a correlate for him to ſtand related to? Either he muſt be an Officer or no Officer. If there be no Church exiſting that he is over, then no Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer exiſteth, for they exiſt and periſh together, as to the ſame degree of being.</p>
               <p>What he meaneth by habit of Office, we know not. He intends not (we ſuppoſe) the indelible cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, which <hi>Bellarm.</hi> ſaith is <hi>qualitas abſoluta,</hi> as every habit, excepting the tenth predicament. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice cannot be proved a qualitative habit, foraſmuch as it is not any thing inherent in body or mind, but ſomething adherent onely.</p>
               <p>And now (Chriſtian Reader) thou mayeſt ſee Dr. <hi>Collings</hi> dealeth not kindly with thee, in perſwading that Officers are nominal relations; Is it not more likely, that Office ſhould be ſuch a relation as is between a father and child, maſter and ſervant, husband and wife, Magiſtrate and ſubject, then ſuch a relation as is between <hi>ſcibile &amp; ſcientia,</hi> a thing to be known, and the knowledge of this thing.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But may not a man be in the Office of Colonel though at preſent he hath neither men to make up a Regiment, nor conſequently the goverment of them? it is his Commiſſion makes him an Officer,</hi> Vind. Revind. pag. 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is but a ſimilitude and ſo proveth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and it will ſerve our purpoſe as well as his, for his Commiſſion doth not make him an habitual Officer, nor give him a power in <hi>actu primo,</hi> to act
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:116041:21"/>
as a Colonel in the goverment of all Regiments in the Army, but limiteth him unto one particular Regiment, and ſo will ſpeak as much againſt a mans being an Officer to any but a particular Church, as it may ſeem to ſpeak for the actual exiſtence of a relation without a correlate.</p>
               <p>2. Here is a begging another queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> That Ordination doth Commiſſionate men to be Officers; this being denyed there is no parity in the caſes, and ſo no ſtrength in the objection.</p>
               <p>We have proved that Election with acceptation doth make men to be Officers, and ſo the correlate, <hi>viz.</hi> the Church electing, doth exiſt as ſoon as the Officer.</p>
               <p>3. We would know, whether a Licence given a man from his Prince, whereby he is impowered to keep ſo many ſervants unto ſuch an end, and ſo to govern them, doth make a man a Maſter, when not one ſervant is engaged by him or related to him?</p>
               <p>4. A Colonels Commiſſion before he hath a Regiment, doth authorize him to raiſe one, &amp; giveth him right unto a Colonels pay, and ſo maketh him an Officer nominal and Titular: but it is the Aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or ſubmiſſion of a Regiment unto him, that maketh him an Officer reall and actual.</p>
               <p>Many Captains and Colonels retain Commiſſions and former Titles, when Wars are ended, and Companies are disbanded, yet are no Officers, but as is expreſſed. If he will yet contend that a Colonel as is inſtanced, is an officer; we ſay further, In ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary caſes a Regiment is Aſſigned to him, and if he hath none, he can be but an extraordinary Officer, anſwerable to Apoſtles having Commiſſion from the General of the Army, as the Apoſtles had their call and Commiſſion immediately from Chriſt, not from
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:116041:21"/>
men, <hi>Ergo</hi> there is no parity in the caſes, and ſo the inſtance is vain.</p>
               <p>Obj. 3. To our third Argument he ſaith, <hi>The Goſpel owneth the Church as the correlate to the Office of the Ministry,</hi> Acts 20. 17. 28. <hi>But not alone,</hi> he ſaith <hi>it owns the work too,</hi> Epheſ. 4. verſ. 11. 12. and Epheſ. 4. <hi>is as much Goſpel as</hi> Act. 20. 17. Vind. Revind. pag. 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In the <hi>Major</hi> of our third Argument no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is wanting, not alone or onely; for the Church alone or onely is the correlate to a Church Officer: ſhould we ſay a wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <p>3. The intendment of ſome names and titles is not to expreſſe what is the Correlate, but ſome thing elſe about a relation: as Officers may be called Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of God and Chriſt, onely to intimate who is the Author and inſtitutor of their office.

               <p>4. We judge his firſt anſwer which he calleth moſt proper to this Queſtion, To whom are they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:116041:22"/>
Officers? moſt improper, For it is this, to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Should a King paſſe through a ſtreet, and it be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired what or whoſe King goeth there, and one ſhould anſwer Chriſts King, he ſhould give a very improper anſwer, and leave the enquirer in the dark; but he that informeth that he is the King of <hi>France</hi> &amp;c. leadeth into light. So for a Mayor, its impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to ſay, there goeth the <hi>Protectors Mayor,</hi> but there goeth the Mayor of <hi>Norwich,</hi> is proper.</p>
               <p>5. Whereas he ſaith, (p. 18.) every creature is the Correlate to office as well as the Church.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If ſo, then the Elders of the Church are the Elders of the World; Angels of the Churches, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of the World; then Paſtors and Teachers ſet in the Church are ſet in the World too; but where did he ever read of Elders of the world? &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2 We would know what is the foundation of the relation between a paſtor and the world: is it foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in nature, as that of Parent and children, or in Will or conſent, as that of Husband and wife, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and Servant, or in ſome third thing?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Then its more proper to call Officers World-Officers then Church Officers; as to call the <hi>Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> Protector of <hi>England</hi> rather then of <hi>London,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the extent of authority and office-power. Nor is that reaſon in the leaſt cogent, <hi>viz.</hi> Officers are appointed to gather out of the World, members unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe an Embaſſador from <hi>England</hi> be in <hi>France</hi> diſpatching buſineſſe for his maſter there, he is not thereby related unto <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So an Embaſſador for <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the world, is not related unto the world as his <hi>Correlate,</hi> but onely to the flock he is ever in the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:116041:23"/>
He ſaith moreover, That <hi>God is the Correlate,</hi> that God is the Author and inſtitutor thereof we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, upon which account there ariſeth a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſical reſpect between Officers and God, and they are the Miniſters of God: but as the <hi>Correlate</hi> of a King is a ſubject, and only that in predicamental relation; he who is to be governed, Ruled, and not God: So the correlate of a Church Officer, is the Church, and onely that which is to be watched over, prayed for, inſtructed by vertue of a ſpecial bond in which the Officer is engaged unto it. The duty of a relation terminates upon the correlate; God were to be governed, if he were the <hi>Correlate</hi> of a Governour.</p>
               <p>6. Preaching Miniſters are expreſſely called <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Church, Acts. 20. v.</hi> 17. He ſent to <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> and called the Elders of the Church. And this is as much as to ſay, The Miniſter of the Church, if not more; for Elder is the name of Office.

               <p>But what is his reaſon?</p>

               <p>Our ſecond Argument he putteth into a form of his own, under a pretence to mend ſome faults it it, and is not ſatisfied with that forme which himſelfe put it into, but then putteth it into an other, and thus findeth himſelf work.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:116041:24"/>
and leſt it to us to mend them, and not caſt them into his own form, and then ſpend time in anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; we ſhall onely ſay this in way of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. As he hath formed the Argument, the Office of the Miniſtry is made the correlate, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we aſſert the Church to be the correlate; let the Reader now judge whether he doth not wrong him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and us, by this way of proceeding.</p>
               <p>2. Our Argument proceeded upon thoſe Relative names and Titles which the Scripture expreſſeth Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers by, and which they cannot loſe without loſing their Office, and which are uſed upon the moſt ſpecial occaſions, and theſe Titles forbid a Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church to be the correlate unto Office as is ſhewn, <hi>Preacher ſent. pag.</hi> 10. 11. &amp;c. As to <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. It concludeth that an Officer is commanded to feed [all] the flock that he ſtandeth in the relation of a Biſhop or Overſeer to, and ſo denyeth a Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church to be that flock which he is an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer or Overſeer to; for he is not commanded to feed [all] the Univerſal Church. And this ſheweth that the terms Paſtor and Teacher, when uſed to expreſſe Office, are taken in a ſtrict ſence to denote onely a relation to a particular Church; for, Biſhops, Paſtors and Teachers are the ſame officers, under different names:</p>
               <p>3. If we were convinced that there were ſuch a Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal viſible Church made up of all particulars, we ſhould then grant that the Office of the Miniſtry as it reſides in every particular Miniſter, had that Church of Churches for its correlate, as much as the Office of a Juſtice of peace (which he inſtanceth in) as it reſides in the whole number of Juſtices hath the whole nation as a correlate; but ſtill we ſhould think that every particular Miniſter were limitted in his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:116041:24"/>
Office to a particular Church, as a Juſtice is to a particular County; Dr. <hi>Collings</hi> uſeth three Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove that the Office of the Miniſtry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates not onely to the particular Church, but to the Catholick Church, <hi>viz.</hi> that they may do acts of Office and Authority beyond the bounds of that particular Church over which they are more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſet.</p>

                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 1. Thoſe whom God hath given for the edifying of the body of <note place="margin">

               <p>2. This Argument doth not conclude the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if ſuch a Univerſal Church could be proved, we might grant them to be ſome way related to it, yet not as Officers. His Argument, if it were to the purpoſe, ſhould conclude not onely that Paſtors and Teachers are related to the Univerſal Church, but 1. As Officers. 2. As to their correlate; whereas if a Univerſal Church were the body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> there intended, the place alledged, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. doth only ſpecifie that the edifying of that body is one end of giving Paſtors and Teachers, and a correlate muſt be exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the end of the relatoin can be attained, and ſo that body may not be the correlate to Paſtors and Teachers.</p>
               <p>In his following this Argument there is an alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the phraſe, from the Univerſal viſible Church or body, about which the queſtion is, unto the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal body of <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we grant that Paſtors and Teachers are related to the myſtical body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> which is made up one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:116041:25"/>
of the Elect, yet we may deny them to be related to it as Offices, or that to be the correlate to their Office: They may be given for the edifying of that body, although they have no work appointed them by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to do, but onely in a particular Church; that body is edified if any member of it be edified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 2. Thoſe whom God hath commiſſionated to Preach and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vind. Revin. Pag.</hi> 34.</note> all Nations, are not related onely to a particular Church, but to the Catholike Church, yea to the whole world.</p>

               <p>We ſay, thoſe whom God hath commiſſionated to Preach to and Baptize all Nations, are ſo related to particular Churches, as that they may not do acts (materially and formally) of Office and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, beyond the bounds of the particular Churches they are over. As the whole number of Juſtices of Peace in this Nation are commiſſionated to perform the acts of Juſtices in all Counties and ſhires in <hi>England,</hi> yet the office of a Juſtice of Peace, as it reſides in this or that particular perſon (as himſelf obſerveth, <hi>Vind. Revind. pag.</hi> 31. 32.) is limited by his Commiſſion to ſuch a County, and he cannot act as a Juſtice beyond the bounds of that County of ſhire. So the whole number of Church-Officers may be commiſſionated to perform acts of Office in all Nations, yet the Office as it reſides in this or that particular perſon is limited to a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church, ſo as none may do acts of Office beyond the bounds of that particular Church which the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is over.</p>

2. To his minor we ſay, The commiſſion <hi>(Mat.</hi> 28. 19.) was not onely for the Apoſtles in the ſubſtance, but in the Univerſality it was for them onely.</p>
               <p>Apoſtles as ſuch were extraordinary Officers, and had no ſucceſſors. Were this Commiſſion ours in the Univerſality, we ſee not how we could fix with a good conſcience. As warrantably might a man confine his miniſtry to a family when appointed to a Church, as confined to a church when appointed for all the world.</p>
               <p>Our granting that the commiſſion reacheth Officers now in the ſubſtance of it, is enough to evidence how far we are from ſhaking hands with <hi>Socinus, Smalcius, &amp;c.</hi> though we deny their Office to have the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that the Apoſtles had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 3. His third Argument is drawn <hi>ab abſurdo. Vind. Revind. p.</hi> 35. There are five abſurdities which he layeth at our door, againſt which we have ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſtified our ſelves in the body of our diſcourſe; out of the womb of two principles he mid-wives forth theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> 1. That the Authority of him who Preacheth, is that which makes the action of the hearer duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> 2. That an act of Office cannot be done by him who is no Officer. <hi>Vind. Revind. pag.</hi> 35.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The latter of theſe is fully ſpoken to, <hi>Preacher ſent. pag.</hi> 278. 279. 280.</p>
               <p>And in the ſame book we have largely proved this principle, That many gifted men (who are not in Office) have Authority or a command and warrant from Chriſt to Preach. From which joyned with</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Collings</hi> firſt principle afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, it will appear that the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vind. Revin. Pag.</hi> 36.</note> he talketh of, are pitiful <hi>non ſequiturs.</hi> For, hence it followes,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That where there are no particular Churches formed, yet the people are bound to come to hear;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:116041:26"/>
becauſe many gifted men (not in office) have au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to preach, and it is the authority of the ſpeaker (ſaith he) that maketh the action of the hearer du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and this taketh off his firſt abſurdity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That in <hi>England</hi> where there is neither Church nor officer, yet they may wait upon that publike meanes which is a ſpecial appointment of Chriſt to ſave their ſouls; for gifted men (not in office) have authority to preach; and ſo his ſecond abſurdity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to nothing.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That where a particular Church is formed, when their Officer preacheth not on the Lords day, yet the members are bound to hear, though gifted men (not in office) preach, for they have authority from Chriſt to do it.</p>
               <p n="4">4 That perſons not of that Miniſters Church who Preacheth, may go in faith; for he hath authority as a gifted man to preach unto thoſe that are not members of his Church; and ſo his fourth abſurdity is taken away.</p>
               <p>His <hi>fift,</hi> Concerning giving the Sacrament to one that is not a member of his Church, we have ſpoken ſufficiently to elſewhere. And here let us expoſtulate a little, can Dr. <hi>Collings</hi> ſee a <hi>mote,</hi> and can he not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a <hi>Beam?</hi> doth he ſtrain a t a <hi>Gnat</hi> and ſwallow a <hi>camel?</hi> Are there not greater abſurdities in his way?</p>
               <p n="1">1 Is it not an abſurdity to engage a man by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to preach, when none are ingaged to hear? ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ordination make an officer, <hi>ſinetitulo</hi> (which may be in Dr. <hi>Collings</hi> judgement) a Paſtor, Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or overſeer, to whoſe charge no man or compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of men is committed, to whom none are bound. Where ever this pretended officer Preacheth upon the Lords day, the people may leave him and goe to other Miniſters (eſpecially if ordained alſo) whom

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wherein a brief anſwer is given to the exceptions againſt our two firſt arguments for the preaching of gifted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons without ordination.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>DR. <hi>Collings</hi> in his ſecond Chapter chiefly telleth us what he underſtandeth by authoritative preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He ſaith the authority of the preacher, 1. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth him to preach, 2. Obligeth people to hear.</p>
               <p>Our arguments for the preaching of gifted men being built upon a command of Chriſt, a Goſpel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, &amp;c. will evidence that they are obliged to preach, and that ſouls ſin in neglecting to hear them, &amp; that there is an authoritative preaching in that ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whereas <hi>(pag.</hi> 45.) he oppoſeth it to precarious preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in which the preacher may beg, but cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand either auditory, or attention.</p>
               <p>We anſwer, His colonel which he mentioneth <hi>(Vin. pag.</hi> 15.) may beat his drum and none are bound to follow him; So that a Colonel is no officer, or this
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:116041:28"/>
inſtance ſheweth it to be no ſin not to hear an ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man, as well as not to hear a gifted brother.</p>
               <p>We would know whether a man who hath ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Ordination which Dr. <hi>Collings</hi> pleadeth for, can command either Auditory or attention when none have deſired him to Preach to them, or no particular Church hath by Election made him their Miniſter? or, whether the Miniſter of one Church, can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand another Church to be his Auditory, and to give attention to him without or againſt the conſent of the Paſtor thereof?</p>
               <p>If he will ſay, he cannot in ſuch caſes command Auditory or attention, then it followeth that it is not Authoritative Preaching out of a mans own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, or to any but thoſe that call him; and ſo it is Preaching <hi>ex dono,</hi> not <hi>ex officio</hi> to others, and then it is election or the deſire of the people, and not Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination that maketh it Authoritative Preaching in that ſence; for a man is ordained and yet is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to preach to any, nor any people obliged to hear him. If they be under a general obligation to Preach when opportunity or a call is offered, ſo are gifted men.</p>
               <p>If he will ſay they can command it, let him prove it, &amp; whom they may require to hear, when Churches are full of Paſtors. We urged diverſe Arguments for the Preaching of ſome men without Ordination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 1. From the Antecedaneouſneſs of Election to Ordination, <hi>Preacher Sent. p.</hi> 29.</p>
               <p>Obj. Dr. Collings <hi>knoweth no need of any Preaching in order to election, but onely twice or thrice to try a mans utterance, and denyeth the election of a particular Church as neceſsary to precede Ordination, &amp;c.</hi> Vind. Revind. pag. 45. 46.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> A tryal what gifts a man hath for Scripture interpretation, and of the ſutableneſs of a mans gifts to ſuch a people, &amp;c. maketh ordinary Preaching ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:116041:28"/>
in order to election, as well as the tryal of utterance.</p>
               <p>2. Election did precede Ordination, <hi>Act. 6. verſ.</hi> 5. they choſe <hi>Stephen, verſ. 6. And when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.</hi> Dr. <hi>Collings</hi> asketh whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we think that the election there was by the whole multitude?</p>
               <p>We anſwer yes, for it is expreſſely ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>v.</hi> 5 the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pleaſed [the whole multitude] and [they] choſe <hi>Stephen, &amp;c.</hi> [they] who choſe the Text anſwereth the whole multitude. Their being divided becauſe ſome widows were neglected in the daily miniſtration, did not hinder their agreeing together in the chuſing of Deacons, which was propounded as a means purpoſely for the healing of thoſe diviſions, neither doth the number (if it were ſo great) forbid it, for more have met.</p>
               <p>We expected his attempting to give ſome Text to prove Ordination antecedent to or without Election, but he waveth that altogether.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 2. From Goſpel commands, 1 <hi>Pet. 4 ver. 10. 11. Hebr. 10. 25. Preach. ſent. p.</hi> 32.</p>
               <p>Obj. Dr. <hi>Collings</hi> his chief exceptions againſt this are. 1. If any one, who hath ability, may diſpenſe the the gift, then gifted brethren may adminiſter bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme and the Lords Supper too by vertue of this Text. <hi>Vind. p.</hi> 50. 2. The context ſpeaketh of the good things of this world, <hi>pag.</hi> 50. 3. If the ability to Preach be the gift only meant, he that never had the Oracles of God committed to him, cannot ſpeak them as the Oracles of God; And however this was when the Church was in a ſcattered ſtate, <hi>pag.</hi> 51.</p>
               <p>4. He inclineth to take it in the latitude, for any communicable gift, but it muſt be miniſtered in a due way and order, and upon a regular C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, <hi>Vind. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vind. pag.</hi> 55.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. We do not limit it to the gift of Preaching,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:116041:29"/>
but ſay, that is one ſpecial gift intended, 1 <hi>Pet. 4. v.</hi> 11. If any man ſpeak, &amp;c. and ſo it cannot be reſtained to this worlds goods.</p>
               <p>And the foregoing and following exhortations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left in general amongſt the Saints, and a note of univerſality being uſed here, <hi>v.</hi> 10. [as every man &amp;c.] hence the generality of thoſe that have grace and the gift of Scripture interpretation are commanded to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter that gift; and hence gift cannot be reſtrained to Office, ſeeing many are ſo gifted who are no Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers.</p>
               <p>And the gift of Preaching being a publike gift <hi>(i. e.</hi> ſuch as fitteth for, and is moſtly laid out in a publike way) hence it is very probable that an uſe of it in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Aſſemblies is that which the Apoſtle driveth at, eſpecially ſeeing other Texts do warrant gifted men in ſuch publike actings, as <hi>Hebr. 10. 25. Act.</hi> 18 26. 28.</p>
               <p>2. Neither may every one that is gifted adminiſter Baptiſme and the Supper, by vertue of this Text. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The gift of Preaching is particularized, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 11. the adminiſtration of Sacraments not ſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some Preaching is an act of meer charity, no miniſtering of Seals is ſo. Every friend of the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome according to his ability may ſerve the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome in acts of charity, but none can ſerve him in thoſe rites wherein mutual engagement is Sealed, but one appointed eſpecially thereunto.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Dr. <hi>Collings</hi> is at liberty to Preach many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons without the knowledge or expreſſe conſent of his elderſhip, but not to ſuſpend one member from the Supper, or admit one thereto; there is then ſome difference between the diſpenſation of the word, and the adminiſtration of Sacraments.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Baptiſme and the Lords S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pperare act ſo purely of inſtitution, that they would never have been duties, nor could have been known to be ſo, without Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-light;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:116041:29"/>
and ſo are not to be diſpenſed by any (though gifted) without an allowance thereunto by the inſtitution, which is the onely determining rule about the Adminſtrator and Adminiſtration.</p>
               <p>But as prayer is a natural duty, though commanded over in the Goſpel, and many rules laid down to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate &amp; direct in the performance of it; So Preaching in it ſelf, is an act of natural worſhip, if there had been no Scripture rules laid down about it, yet man by natures light might have learned it to be a duty to publiſh the will God his Creator unto others accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ability and opportunity, and therefore the Law of nature doth firſtly lay gifted men under obligations to Preach, and this is ſeconded by Goſpel rules, as in the Text alledged.</p>
               <p>3. It is nothing to his purpoſe, if gift be underſtood of Alms or Office, unleſſe it be excluſive, and that it cannot be limited to them onely, we proved in our former book, and he inclineth to take it for any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable gift <hi>(Vind. Revind. pag.</hi> 55.) and ſo he cannot reſtrain it unto Alms or Office.</p>
               <p>But if his Arguments did prove it very probable that by gift is meant Office (which they do not) they were equally ſtrong to prove that Alms are not the gift chiefly intended. It might then be ſaid, the gift is to be adminiſtered as Stewards, and to acts of Office are inſtanced in <hi>ver</hi> 11. and therefore it is meant only of Office, not of Alms, which many men out of Office may give; and when ſome of his Arguments will ſerve as anſwers unto others, or when he is found an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering himſelf, let the Reader judge, whether that childiſhneſs which he mentioned <hi>(Vind. Revind. p.</hi> 49.) be to be found in our replies, or in his Arguments?</p>
               <p>4. The Church was not in ſuch a ſcattered ſtate, but that it had Officers in it, for its ſaid, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 1. The Elders which are [among you] I exhort, &amp;c. If gifted
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:116041:30"/>
men may Preach in Churches that have Elders in them, much more may they do it elſewhere.</p>
               <p>5. The main ſtreſs is upon the Call.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> What gives a Call to Preach?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. That which maketh an habitual Prophet, Preacher, &amp;c. (although we allow not actual and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual in relations, yet otherwiſe we allow it) juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the actual, except the hearers be incapacitated as to that priviledge. If men be Prophets in the collati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of grace, and a gift through the uſe of means, who will forbid them prophecy? but rather wiſh as <hi>Moſes, Num.</hi> 11. 29.</p>
               <p>2. Chriſts command concerning a work, is mans Call to do it, as in hearing, praying, faſting, &amp;c. Dr. <hi>Collings</hi> doth ſuppoſe in ſome time the bare command of Chriſt may make an Officer, <hi>Vind. Revind. pag.</hi> 63. We ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe at all times a preacher<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>The commanding every man that hath preaching gifts and graces to miniſter with them, doth deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that the Oracles of God are committed to them, and that it is Gods way and order that they ſhould be exerciſed in the work of preaching.</p>
               <p>As to what he ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 52. 53. we anſwer, the command of Chriſt being a Call, it warrants their preaching on the Sabbath or Lords day, as well as at other times; and whether gifted perſons preaching be a publike Ordinance for ſaving of ſouls, let the Reader judge by our Arguments.</p>
               <p>It was allowed of and deſired by the Reformers of <hi>Scotland;</hi> for, in their Petition to the Queen they did ask. 1. That they might have prayers publikely in their vulgar Tongue. 2. That if any hard place of Scripture were read in their meetings, it might be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to any qualified perſons in knowledge, being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to interpret and open, &amp;c. <hi>Hiſt.</hi> of Reform. of <hi>Scot.

pag.</hi> 128. which practice was of uſe in the Jewiſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations <hi>Grot.</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 23.</p>
               <p>The inſtance of a Magiſtrate is not paralel. 1. Gifts make not powers. 2. This inſtance will deſtroy pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate preachers, none may do the Act of a Magiſtrate privately, but a Magiſtrate. That the Adminiſtration of publike Ordinances is peculiar to publike Officers; and that thoſe who have publike gifts and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are meerly private perſons, let him prove; will he deny Synodical determinations to be adminſtrations of publike Ordinances? it is certain that thoſe who were no Officers, even the multitude did publikely act in that Synod, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. ſee <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. 22. 23. Surely no judicious Reader will think that there is weight in theſe exceptions. As to <hi>Heb. 10. v.</hi> 25. who can queſtion its being a warrant for ordinary Church Aſſemblies? was it not a Church or Churches that the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> is written to? will he deny Church Aſſemblies to be publike meetings? is not exhortation the work en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned in them? are Officers onely put upon this work? what ſyllable of proof is there in the Text for any ſuch aſſertion? where do we alleadge this place for private meetings?</p>
               <p>It is aſſerted by ſome, that by gift probably is meant Office; after ſhewing the improbillity of it diverſe waves, we add theſe words <hi>(Preach. ſent. p.</hi> 59.)</p>
               <p>[The Apoſtle ſpeaketh indefinitely [a gift] and an indefinite propoſition is equipollent uſually to an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, and ſo it may be extended to all gifts in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and therefore cannot without ſome ſpecial reaſon be reſtrained to one particular gift, <hi>viz.</hi> Office.]</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ob. Dr.</hi> Collings <hi>would infer that then men not commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated for the Magiſtracy, nor ordained to the Miniſtry (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a talent or ability) may execute Juſtice and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Sacraments,</hi> Vind. Revind. p. 57.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Talents or gifts may be conſidered as <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentia abſoluta</hi> or <hi>relativa.</hi> Abſolute accidents alter not the ſtate of the ſubject; relative make a ſuperiour and inferior.</p>
               <p>Aptitude to govern is an abſolute accident, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not a Migiſtrate.</p>
               <p>2. Talents or gifts which are abſolute accidents are to be improved according to the nature of ſuch talents or gifts; he that is apt to governe may helpe in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by council and advice, without pretence of power over thoſe whom he doth direct. A skilfull ſea-man may direct the Pilate, not ſtepping into his place; we muſt diſtinguiſh, <hi>Miniſterium circa Eccleſiam quae jam in corpus collecta est &amp; manet, a miniſterio circa illos qui colligendi caritativa admonitione ſivelint,</hi> as Voctius <hi>tells</hi> Janſenius, <hi>Deſp. Cauſ. Pap. l.</hi> 2. Sect. 1. Cap. 10.</p>
               <p>3. A particular exception is enough to limit any general rule; Some Lawes of <hi>England</hi> run in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral termes, yet by ſome particular proviſo; the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities or ſome Corporations are exempted from obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to them; all others (not excepted) will be liable to the penalty, if they tranſgreſſe the Law. So if a King promiſeth a reward to every ſubject that ſhall do ſome notable ſervice, except thoſe of ſome particular Corporation, it is plain that all (not excepted) have allowance to do the work, and thereupon may expect the reward. Now the promiſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 29. running in general termes, hence every man (not excepted) is to uſe his talents. If by a particular exception the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:116041:32"/>
adminiſtration of ſacraments be limited unto office yet this doth not deny a liberty to uſe other talents, and to expect the benefit of this promiſe in the uſe of them, ſeeing it is ſaid, [unto every one that hath, ſhall be given.] He granteth that men may preach di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times as probationers, when they are no officers, but may not do the worke of a Magiſtrate, or adminiſter Sacraments without thoſe offices. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the exerciſe of preaching gifts is more ſeparable from office then the other.</p>
               <p>We fully anſwered this objection, <hi>Preacher Sent. pag.</hi> 39. 40. 162. and therefore let not the Reader expect any further anſwer from us, though Dr. <hi>Collings</hi> often cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth this in to help him.</p>

               <p n="1">1. In the ſpecies of their gifts, there might be office or extraordinary gifts; <hi>Apollo</hi> is ranked with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter, 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 12. called a Miniſter, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. and was mighty in the Scriptures; It is plain he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed onely in order to office, <hi>p.</hi> 59.

with a praeceptive impreſſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 31. there was <hi>neceſſitas medij,</hi> there was no other ordinary meanes of Salvation for theſe people, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ind. Revind. p.</hi> 61. 62.</p>
               <p>Anſ. 1. <hi>Apollo's</hi> gifts were not of an other ſpecies; <hi>Adam and Abel,</hi> not two ſpecies of men, though <hi>Adam</hi> by creation, <hi>Abel</hi> by generation: nor the habits in <hi>Adam</hi> a divers ſpecies from them in <hi>Abel,</hi> becauſe they infuſed theſe acquired. If <hi>Apollo's</hi> gifts had been infuſed (which yet is not granted) this would not prove them of a divers ſpecies; but his being mighty in the Scriptures, maketh it probable that he received them in an ordinary way, as now a dayes, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Scriptures and not otherwayes, as the Doctor ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth.</p>
               <p>He wrongeth himſelfe and us, in affirming <hi>(pag.</hi> 59.) that we ſay nothing to this; but let thoſe who ſay it prove it, the contrary may be ſeen: <hi>Preacher Sent. p.</hi> 71. 72. 73. yet it being an endleſſe work to anſwer the groundleſſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urmiſes of men, we had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to deſire proof.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Apollo</hi> knew onely the baptiſm of <hi>Iohn, Acts 18. 25. Ergo, Apollo</hi> neither had extraordinary gifts, nor did preach in order to office or ordination; for without knowing more then the baptiſme of <hi>Iohn,</hi> he could not know theſe which belong to the baptiſm of Chriſt, <hi>Mat. 3. 11. He</hi> (i. e. Jeſus Chriſt) <hi>ſhall baptize you with the holy Ghoſt.</hi> And that he ſhould preach as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bationer to a woman, <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> and that at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> in order to Office at <hi>Corinth,</hi> how unlikely is it? As to the Scattered Chriſtians; If all mentioned, <hi>Acts.</hi> 4. 31. had extraordinary preaching gifts, and were 8000. in number, (which yet we do not grant) then the Goſpel knoweth occaſional preachers; for, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny could not have opportunity for conſtant preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that Church, neither can it be proved that they
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:116041:33"/>
did it elſe-where before the ſcattering. Alſo then he muſt ſay that here was a whole Church of Preachers, which is more ſtrange then that, in theſe dayes there ſhould be in Churches ſome gifted men, (beſides Officers) who may Preach.</p>
               <p>Some think that the ſpeaking the word with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, mentioned, <hi>v.</hi> 31. hath reference to the Apoſtles as an anſwer of that prayer for them, <hi>v.</hi> 29. 30. but we ſay it cannot be proved that they were the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary gifts of the holy Ghoſt that they are there ſaid to be filled with, and ſo the objection vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth.</p>
               <p>2 As for parity of Acts, <hi>Apollo</hi> preached publikely in the Synogogue, and Chriſtians heard him, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 26. and this he did not with the allowance of the Jewiſh Church onely, but of Chriſt. And if afterward he were an officer (which we know not but he might, though upon his proofs we do not conclude it) yet now he was none.</p>
               <p>The ſcattered Chriſtians went every where preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 4. and therefore they acted publickly, as well as privately.</p>
               <p>He muſt aſſert an order of private preachers, who may goe every where, preaching in private houſes, but may not do it in publick, or elſe this exception <hi>(Vind. Revind. p.</hi> 61.) is vain.</p>
               <p>3. As to the ſtate of the Church, as it was an infant ſtate, ſo Chriſt provided extraordinary Officers, as Apoſtles, and gave extraordinary gifts, for the nurſing of it up in infancy; but (as we have proved) <hi>Apollo</hi> had no ſuch gifts, and the Dr. ſaith <hi>(p.</hi> 59.) its plain that he preached onely [in order to Office] by which he plainly granteth, that for the preſent he was no Officer at all of a Goſpel Church. And let it be proved that any others had an allowance in that infant ſtate, to act in Goſpel-adminiſtrations (which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:116041:33"/>
were at other times peculiar to office) as <hi>Apollo</hi> had; if preaching were ſo, all preſidents or examples re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the New Teſtament refer to that infant ſtate of the Church; and therefore no argument; for Goſpel preſidents could be vailed, if the infancy of the Church could hinder it, becauſe that may be alleadged againſt all, &amp; that ſome preſidents have the force of a rule, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe granteth, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ind. Revind. pag.</hi> 58. and others <hi>Jus Dinin. Min. pag.</hi> 160. 161. as for thoſe <hi>Acts</hi> 8. there being in a perſecuted ſtate will not make ſuch a caſe of neceſſity as he ſpeaketh of; for it doth not appear that all theſe ſcattered Saints which preached had ſuch extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghoſt; &amp; however ſuch extraordinary preaching gifts are to be uſed in the moſt tranquil &amp; ſetled ſtate of the Church, though many Miniſters ordained be preſent, and therefore perſecution (about which we are now ſpeaking) could not put them under any ſuch preceptive impreſſion as might render their preaching lawful now, which in a ſetled ſtate of the Church would be unlawfull.</p>
               <p>And upon this ſuppoſition that it was the will of God his Goſpel ſhould at that time be made known to thoſe people, no ſuch neceſſity as he talketh of will be evinced from it.</p>
               <p>If Churches had loſt their Officers by perſecution, there were a greater colour for ſuch a plea, but here the caſe was otherwaies, for the Apoſtles (who were Officers) were not ſcattered, neither was it the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted Church that was preached to, but others. How mens being perſecuted from their habitations can ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their preaching Lawful, which otherwiſe were not, or lay them under either a natural or moral neceſſity to preach in their travels, beyond what they ſhould have, if their occaſions did lead them to the ſame places without perſecution, we underſtand not.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtles (who were by Chriſts appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:116041:34"/>
to preach, not onely in the Regions of <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Samaria</hi> (where this ſcattering was, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 1.) but in all Nations, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19.) were neither ſcattered, nor neceſſitated (that it appeareth) to ſtay where they were, by the perſecution; and therefore there was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means of ſalvation for thoſe people, though theſe ſcattered Saints had not preached, when the Lord had Officers of his own near, <hi>viz.</hi> Apoſtles, yet he would honour gifted perſons in the work of preaching, and this ſheweth that neither his <hi>neceſſitas praecepti,</hi> nor <hi>neceſſitas medii</hi> can weaken the force of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>We are at as great a loſſe to find any ordination of an ordinary officer without a precedent Election by a particular Church, as he is to find it before the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Paul, Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> who were extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily or immediately called to Office, and ſo needed not ſuch Election.</p>

               <p>2. He hath given no proof for his extraordinary Office, making miſſion in ſuch caſes of neceſſity; and where nothing is proved, nothing need be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>

               <p n="1">1. They muſt be greater then ordained ones; for extraordinary Officers are greater then ordinary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are not to be ordained afterward, though the Church cometh into an other ſtate; or elſe Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not the conſtituting office-making act; for (ſaith he) they were officers before.</p>

And that ordinary officers (Paſtors and Teachers) ſhould be made by an extraordinary call, will hardly be proved.</p>
               <p>Or that ſuch ordinary offices can be convved without Ordination; if that in ordinary caſes be eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to ſuch Offices, we ſuppoſe can never be proved; for, it is as much as to ſay, ſuch offices have a being, without that which giveth being to them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. Our fifth Argument is taken from Goſpel Rules about Prophecying.</p>
               <p>All that are Prophets way ordinarily and publikely preach, 1 <hi>Corin. 14. v.</hi> 23. 24. 29. 31. Dr. <hi>Collings</hi> ſaith <hi>(<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ind. Revind. pag.</hi> 64.) no ſuch gifted men as now live are prophets.</p>
               <p>To prove our <hi>minor,</hi> that ſome men, (i. e. now living) who are not ordained Officers, are Prophets, we lay downe three propoſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Propheſie is a gift, not an office.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Propheſying is a gift ſtill continuing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That ſome men who are not ordained officers, have that gift of Propheſie, <hi>Preacher Sent. pag.</hi> 90. Dr. <hi>Collings (pag.</hi> 65.) repeateth three of our arguments, and telleth the Reader, that we bring them to prove, that Propheſie is a gift, not an office, and cryeth out of a pittiful <hi>non ſequitur, &amp;c.</hi> whereas we uſe thoſe arguments to prove the laſt poſition, which is about the un-neceſſarineſſe of Ordination for prophets; Thus are we miſ-preſented, as if we brought arguments to prove one Propoſition, which we uſe to prove an other, and whether great wrong and injury be not offered to us and the Reader, by ſuch dealing, let any wiſe man judge? We neither argue in this place againſt their being extraordinary, or ordinary officers, nor againſt their being furniſhed with extraordinary gifts, other mediums we uſe elſe-where that way, and therefore his pittifull <hi>non ſequitur</hi> is of his own making: but the main queſtion was about preaching without ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and ſo we proved <hi>(Preacher Sent. pag.</hi> 90.) that ordination was not neceſſary for Prophets, which here he graneth.</p>
               <p>We knew not which part of our argument would be denyed, and therefore left no part unproved.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:116041:35"/>
Whereas he enquireth <hi>(Vind. p.</hi> 65.) who ever ſaid theſe Prophets were ordinary Officers? we anſwer Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> in his due right of Presbyt. declareth it to be his judgement; that this is a pattern of a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ordinary Prophets.</p>
               <p>But neither of the Arguments which he is replying to, ſpeak one word about their being ordinary officers, and therefore we wonder how that queſtion ſhould be ſtarted here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 1. The propheſying ſpoken of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. is a gift, not an Office. 1. Becauſe all who have the gift of propheſie are Prophets, and they muſt have the gift before they can be made Prophets by Office. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this propheſying ought in duty and might in faith be coveted by every man who was a member of the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and ſo of any other Church, whereas Office might not be ſo coveted by every man who was a member of a Church. 1. It is not promiſed. 2 Not poſſible to be obtained, &amp;c. <hi>Preach. Sent. p.</hi> 91. 92.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>Dr.</hi> Collings (pag. 66. 67. &amp;c.) <hi>ſaith. 1. That God in the ſame moment clothed them with an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary authority, and furniſhed them with an extraordinary gift, ſo he did</hi> Jeremy, Amos, &amp;c. 2. <hi>That the ſame argument will prove it was no gift, except a promiſe can be ſhewn thereof. 3. Things not neceſſary to ſalvation ſhould be prayed for with ſubmiſſion to Gods will &amp;c. 4. They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Officers to that Church, but may be in time Officers to other Churches, there is no impoſſibility in this at all, yea (he ſaith) they ought to labour after ſuch a perfection. Beſides <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal holineſs may and ought to be laboured for, yet it is not promiſed, nor can be attained, &amp;c. 5. All doth not include every individual alwayes, &amp;c.</hi>

Sent. pag.</hi> 100. 101. 102. and ſo our Argument is valid, though extraordinary Officers, as <hi>Jeremy</hi> and <hi>Amos,</hi> ſhould have the gift and Office together; yet there, the gift in order of nature at leaſt doth precede the Office, which authorize to ſuch an exerciſe of the gift.</p>
               <p>2. There is a promiſe of the very gift of propheſie, which is of far larger extent then office. <hi>Joel 2. 28 I will pour out my ſpirit upon all fleſh, &amp; your ſons and your daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhall propheſie,</hi> &amp;c. This [all fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſh] cannot be limited unto Officers. This promiſe began to be fulfilled, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. but its full accompliſhment is not yet, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, <hi>Joel 3. ver.</hi> 1. The captivity of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> is not yet recovered, the <hi>Jews</hi> not yet convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and this ſhall be [in thoſe dayes] <hi>i. e.</hi> wherein the pouring out of the ſpirit ſhall be, for thoſe were the daves before mentioned.</p>
               <p>Both ſons and daughters ſtill have a gift of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-interpretation, which is a gift of propheſie. And this promiſe of the gift of propheſie being ſo general, hence our Argument will not prove that it was no gift, as he ſaith.</p>
               <p>3. Prayers for the gift of propheſie, or any other mercies which are to be begged with ſubmiſſion to the will of God, cannot be in duty or faith, without they be limited and bounded by ſome Divine word or promiſe: for it is a humane faith which hath not a Divine word to bottom upon, and if it were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, any man might pray that he might be made a King, an Emperour, or to have an eſtate of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> or to live many thouſand years on earth, or what he pleaſed, and this might warrant him therein, that he prayed for them with ſubmiſſion to the will of God.</p>
               <p>If a Divine word be the boundary of ſuch ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then a particular mans recovery out of ſickneſs
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:116041:36"/>
may be owned as a fruit of Promiſe, and then there muſt be ſome Divine word for every mans becoming an officer who was a member of the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> elſe they could not in duty or in faith covet it; and it cannot be imagined that ſuch a word ſhould be limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Corinth,</hi> and therefore it muſt extend to the Church of <hi>Epheſus, Smyrna,</hi> and any other Goſpel Church; and ſo it muſt amount to thus much, That all the men who were members of any Goſpel Church were bound in duty and might in faith covet to be Church officers, and how likely it is that this ſhould be a truth, and how well it agreeth with our brethrens Principles who deny the Preaching of gifted men, let the Reader judge. And if he liketh not our Argument from a promiſe, he may take it from a precept, and then he muſt ſay, That every man who was a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and ſo of any other Goſpel Church, was commanded to covet to be an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, if propheſying were an office; for every man was commanded to covet to propheſie, 1 <hi>Cor. 14. ver.</hi> 1. 5. 39.</p>
               <p>4. We apprehend there is an impoſſibility (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the revealed will of God) of many mens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Officers, who are Church-members, hinted in that place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. which we have (according to his wiſh) thought upon, but although it ſeemeth to deny that all members of the Church can attain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame Office, gifts, or meaſure of them, yet it doth not deny that there may be a joynt concurrence of all in matters of common concernment, nor the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the ſuffrage of the meaneſt members.</p>
               <p>And by ſeveral paſſages in his book <hi>(pag.</hi> 2.) we are apt to think, that he doth not encourage the members of his Church to covet to be Officers either there or in other Churches, though <hi>(pag.</hi> 68.) he ſaith (if we miſtake him not) this is ſuch a perfection as they ought to labour after. The <hi>London</hi> Miniſters are of another
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:116041:37"/>
mind; for <hi>Jus Div. Min. pag. 85.</hi> they deny it to be a common duty to ſtudy Divinity, in order to Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Univerſal holineſs is promiſed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. <hi>ver.</hi> 26. A new heart will I give you, <hi>ver.</hi> 29. I will ſave you from all your uncleanneſſes. If he meaneth Univerſal holineſs in reſpect of degrees, it is promiſed to, and ſhall be injoyed in another life, and ſo the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it there is to be ſought for here.</p>
               <p>We are to labor for the higheſt pitch of holines which is attainable in this life, and this is promiſed. But that which is impoſſible to be attained, is not to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted. And it is conſiderable that no Church is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to covet to be Apoſtles or Evangeliſts, or Paſtors, or Teachers, but a Church is exhorted to covet the gift of propheſie, and therefore that gift may more generally be coveted, then the loweſt of thoſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</p>
               <p>5. The term all doth include the generality of thoſe ſpoken to, and that is enough to our purpoſe. He granteth <hi>(pag. 69.)</hi> that priority of order is no infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Argument where there is any other Scripture, or any found reaſon to evince it, no intention of the holy pen-men; and that both are found in this caſe, our Arguments for their being ordinary Prophets do ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently prove.</p>
               <p>We do not conclude that thoſe Texts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11. 12. are meant of extraordinary Prophets, but upon this ſuppoſition that they [muſt be Officers] we think it will not follow, that thoſe. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. muſt be ſo alſo. As if he lay upon the catch, he cryeth out, we take them at their word, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing its not impoſſible that the one place ſhould ſpeak of one fort of Prophets, and the other place of another, we might uſe an [it may be] about it, for that often denoteth but a poſſibility, and leaveth the matter dubious, <hi>Ezek. 2. 3.

St.</hi> Pauls <hi>charging</hi> Timothy <hi>to ſtudy and meditate, &amp;c. was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain proof, that this prophecying is ceaſed.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is not proved that the prophecying, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. was a gift of infallible Revelation, or of foretelling things to come, and therefore the ceaſing of ſuch gifts, and the charging <hi>Timothy</hi> to ſtudy and meditate are far from proving that this prophecying is ceaſed.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>John Tillinghaſt</hi> neither pretended to ſuch an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary gift of foretelling things to come, or infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Revelation as he ſpeaketh of, and therefore is very impertinently alleadged here. The firſt ſtirring of the <hi>Jews</hi> he thought in probability and greateſt likelihood (from Scriptures numbers) would be in the year 1656. <hi>vid. Generat. work. p. 50. Key to Myſt. N. pag. 248. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the times. pag. 97.</hi> he doth not ſpeak of it as certainly and infallibly to come to paſſe, that yet we find; and if he had, many worthy men have been miſtaken in the myſtical numbers; and therefore it is an unworthy act to ſeek thus to blemiſh his name af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death. That which he ſpeaketh of Prelates, is but to caſt <hi>odium,</hi> for neither Arch-Biſhops nor Biſhops
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:116041:38"/>
can ſhew any inſtitution of Chriſt for their office: they have not an immediate vocation, or infallible directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or power for miraculous operation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they cannot rationally pretend to ſuch a general Commiſſion as Apoſtles and Evangeliſts had.</p>
               <p>2. If by ordinary he intendeth Common, in that ſence the gift of Tongues and healing in thoſe dayes were ordinary, though the way and manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying thoſe gifts, and the end of them was extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, <hi>Act. 2. ver. 3. 4. 1 Cor. 14. 22.</hi> Tongues are for a ſign.</p>
               <p>But that was ordinary which had not a temporary reaſon for its uſe, or which did not require an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Call, to enable to, and warrant in coming up to it, or which men are commonly in after ages gifted for, even unto this day, and whoſe nature, acts and ends were not extraordinary; And whether our Arguments do not prove prophecying in theſe reſpects to be ordinary, and ſo ſtill continuing, let the Reader <hi>judge.</hi> Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> ſaith, that theſe Prophets and our Paſtors differ not in ſpecies and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that to him, this is a pattern of a Colledge of ordinary Prophets. &amp;c. which ſtill rendreth us per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> thought the gift of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie was ordinary; for ſurely he knew that an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary gift did make one differ in ſpecies &amp; nature from ordinary Officers; Only he judged that the way and manner of conferring that gift was extraordinary, ordinarily it is acquired by ſtudy and induſtry, then (he ſuppoſed) it was infuſed, But as it was an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary viſive faculty (as other mens) which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon the man born blind, and wine of an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſpecies which was made, <hi>John</hi> 2 though the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of production was extraordinary; ſo the gift of propheſie was ordinary in his account, though by a maze of words. Dr. <hi>Collings</hi> would perſwade the Reader
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:116041:38"/>
otherwiſe. We proved this prophecying to be an ordinary gift, and ſo ſtill continuing, becauſe, 1. The Rules to regulate the work are ordinary. 2. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of it ordinary, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 3. 3. One great end of extraordinary prophecying <hi>(viz.</hi> to be a ſign) is denied to this, 1 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 14. 22. 4. Women are forbidden this publike prophecying, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 34. yet extraordinary publike prophecying is allowed to them, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 36. 38.</p>
               <p>Obj. 1. <hi>The act may be ordinary, and yet the gift not ſo. Extraordinary Officers, and gifts were to come under general rules of order. 2. So far as it is a deſcription, it is a deſcription of the act, not of the gift,—-onely ſuch ends of prophecying are expreſſed as were common to that with other Ordinances and duties. 3. This Text onely proves that propheſie was no ſign to them that believed not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The onely end of foretelling things to come was not to be a ſign. Their chief act (as be conceiveth) was their infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble interpretation of Scripture by an extraordinary gift, which indeed to them that believed not the Scripture would be of no uſe. 4. Women propheteſſes are not mentioned,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 34. <hi>we do not find that</hi> Anna, Luke 2. 36. <hi>ſpake things to come; and this liberty was restrained,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 37.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Extraordinary acts will follow extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary gifts; for <hi>operari ſequitur eſſe.</hi> That the work of prophecy is ordinary, is not a <hi>fallucious,</hi> but a firm Aru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove the gift to be ordinary alſo, and ſtill continuing; none but ordinary rules are mentioned to regulate prophecyſing, nothing in the deſcription of the work but what is ordinary, and a large chapter is ſpent chiefly in directing about prophecying, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extraordinary is predicated either of the gift or act in the whole chapter, and ſurely this will prove an ordinary gift or work of propheſie to be here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, as ſtrongly as the enumerating onely of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers or perſons extraordinarily gifted, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11. 12.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:116041:39"/>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. 29. (if granted) can prove extraordinary propheſie to be there intended, as he would have it, <hi>Vind. pag.</hi> 70. 77.</p>
               <p>And extraordinary directions were given to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate Apoſtles, and Evangeliſts in the exerciſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary gifts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>2. The act (and ſo the deſcription of it) muſt be ſutable to the gift. Exhortation is here aſſigned unto propheſie, and alſo, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 32. Being Prophets, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted the brethren with many words, where the act of propheſie is denoted by it, and that here onely ſome common ends ſhould be expreſſed by it, how unconceivable is it? Is not exhortation an act? Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and comfort are not ſo; and therefore what triflling is it to ſay the Text proves them to be the act as well as the other? or will not the words, as rendred by him out of the Greek, ſerve as well to our purpoſe, as the Uulgar tranſlation? and can the ſence be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect without [to] or ſome ſuch word? we know not to what end his high words here ſerve, but to make a flouriſh.</p>
               <p>3. That the extraordinary gift or act of fore-telling things to come cannot be the prophecying ſpoken of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. we prove, becauſe one great end of prediction, <hi>viz.</hi> to be a ſign, is denyed unto this prophecying, and that denial is to be found, <hi>ver.</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>Our Argument was not taken from a denial of the act (as he reporteth. <hi>pag</hi> 73.) but of one end, which indeed by conſequence denyeth that to be the gift or act. He faith this Texthat believed not that propheſie was no ſign to them that believed not. We anſwer, this (which he granteth it doth prove) enough to evidence, that fore-telling things to come is not the propheſie here intend, for that was a ſign to them that believed not, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. <hi>ver.</hi> 3 4. The ſign of the Prophet <hi>Jonas</hi> was given to convince a wicked and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:116041:39"/>
Adulterous generation. Neither is there a word in the chapter to prove that the prophecying, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. was a ſign to ſuch as believed, or that the infallible inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Scripture by an extraordinary gift was the act of thoſe Prophets, both which he ſuggeſteth.</p>
               <p>4. If he intendeth onely, that women Propheteſſes are not [expreſſely] mentioned, 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 14. 34. we might anſwer all his arguments at once with this; for the Scripture doth not [expreſly] command all preachers to receive Ordination; If he will ſay they are no way mentioned or intended.</p>
               <p>Then, 1. He contradicteth the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters who uſe theſe words, [by women here are not meant wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſimple, but women Propheteſſes in oppoſition to men Prophets formerly ſpoken of <hi>Jus. Divin. Min. pag.</hi> 100.] yea contradicteth himſelfe; for he faith [it is to be underſtood of women that had or pretended to have the gift of propheſie, <hi>Vind. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>indiciarum, pag.</hi> 119.]</p>
               <p>And by this the Reader may ſee that it is a hard task for us to anſwer both the the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters and Dr. <hi>Collings,</hi> ſeeing they contradict one an other, and the Dr. will rather contradict himſelfe, then want a reply for us.</p>
               <p>2. There is no appearance of truth in it: for, this Chapter ſpeaketh chiefly about the gift of propheſie, ſtiling it [ſpeaking] <hi>v.</hi> 29. yea, a ſpeaking publikely is forbidden to women, <hi>v.</hi> 34. 35. and that ſpeaking in way of propheſie ſhould be excluded (without cogent reaſon to infer it) who can imagin it?</p>
               <p>And if the publick ſpeaking in way of Propheſie be intended (as doubtleſſe it is) then women propheteſſes are mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 34: and our argument ſtandeth firm; neither would the force of it be much abated, if it were granted (which yet it is not) that <hi>Anna (Luk.</hi> 2. 36.) was called a propheteſſe, or that an othery
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:116041:40"/>
were called Prophets from an extraordinary faculty by Revelation to interpret Scripture; and ſo what he faieth is nothing to the preſent purpoſe, for we may argue thus,</p>
               <p>That Propheſying which was an interpreting of Scripture by an extraordinary faculty from Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was permitted unto women, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 36.</p>
               <p>But the propheſying, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. was not permitted unto woman, <hi>v.</hi> 34. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the propheſying. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. was not an interpreting of Scripture by an extraordinary faculty from Revelation, which Dr. <hi>Collings</hi> would have to be the Propheſying there intended, <hi>pag.</hi> 74.</p>
               <p>There is not one ſylable of proof, that foretelling things to come is the propheſying intended, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>We have proved <hi>(Preacher Sent. Pag.</hi> 103.) that this liberty is not reſtrained by the Apoſtle; the Dr. aſſerteth that it is reſtrained, 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 14. 37. yet hath given nothing but his bare word for the proof of it.</p>
               <p>And this is enough to ſhew the weakneſſe of his anſwers to our arguments; we ſhall onely hint a few things in anſwer to what followeth in this Chapter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Propheſying is as much diſtinguiſhed from Revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation as from doctrine, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 6. <hi>except I ſhall ſpeak to you cithes by Revelation or by propheſying or by doctrine:</hi> And therefore as eaſily we may conclude thence, that Propheſying is not Revelation, as he may <hi>(pag.</hi> 76.) that it is not ſpeaking by doctrine. If he wil grant that it is not Revelation, then he contradicteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe <hi>(pag.</hi> 66. 74.) and alſo the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters, <hi>(Jus Div. Mini. pag.</hi> 98.) and conſeſſeth the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of our anſwer to the preſent objection. If he faith it is Revelation, we may ſay, the Prophets ſpeak not by Revelation, that was another thing, and we have as good proof of it, <hi>v.</hi> 6. as he hath there, that they
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:116041:40"/>
ſpake not by doctrine, and therefore he can get no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by this arguing.</p>
               <p>The <hi>London</hi> Miniſters <hi>(pag.</hi> 98.) would prove from <hi>v.</hi> 26. 30. that theſe were extraordinary Prophets, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving extraordinary Revelations: And what is it to the purpoſe, if they did not ſpeak by doctrine? or if Chriſtians ordinarily had not ſuch Revelations as they might publikely and ordinarily communicate them in Church Aſſemblies, might not many unor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained men have ſuch Revelations? or how is this to the buſineſſe in hand? If prophecy ſhould be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Revelation, <hi>v.</hi> 26 (which is not proved) yet ſeeing (as he conſeſſeth) there is ordinary Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, it may be underſtood of that: and the joyning of it in the ſame verſe with doctrine which is ordinary, would as firmely prove the prophet to be ordinary, as the joyning of it with ſome thing extraordinary, would prove it to be extraordinary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His granting <hi>(pag.</hi> 77.) that the note of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity will not prove the gift was extraordinary, is enough to juſtifie our anſwer, and to ſhew that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove what he produced it for, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ind. Min. pag.</hi> 50. nor doth it prove either that the Prophets were Officers, or the gifts extraordinary, but onely a not common gift wherein they are diſtinguiſhed from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther members who have not that gift.</p>

How 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 1. 19. 20. fights againſt us we know not; if he thinketh that it denyeth the interpretation of Scripture to belong to private men, as ſome have conjectured, let him read Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> and others on the place, and he may be informed otherwiſe, if officers rightly ordained do give a humane expoſition of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or ſuch as is not according to the mind of the Holy Ghoſt, that is a private interpretation, which may anſwer his allegations, <hi>pag.</hi> 78. 80.</p>
               <p>3. It is not proved that prophecy is prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before the gift of Tongues, in caſe he that ſpeaketh with Tongues did interpret, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 15: greater is he that Proheſieth, then he that ſpeaketh with Tongues [except the interpreter]—he doth not ſay he is greater when he doth interpret; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when that reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> edification failed, its with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proof, that another muſt be found.

               <p>4. That the [ordinary gifts] of paſtors and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are uſeful to the edifying, Comforting, Convincing, and Converting of Souls, is enough to ſhew that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie cannot be proved to be [an extraordinary gift
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:116041:41"/>
or office] by its uſefulneſſe to ſuch ends, and this was it he would have proved by it, <hi>Vind. Min. p. 51.</hi> and his reply <hi>(Vind. Revind. p. 81.)</hi> doth not hinder its proving as much as we produce it for.</p>
               <p>Neither doth what he ſaith <hi>(p.</hi> 82.) about a word of wiſdom and knowledge prove that Propheſic was an extraordinary gift or office, nor anſwer our reaſons, and ſo its nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>We cannot but wonder at what he ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 84. 85. in one page he calleth in any indifferent Reader, and then any Reader to judge, and addeth that the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Scripture is expreſſe againſt us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 22. and rehearſeth the Words: one would think ſuch a heap of high words ſhould not be uſed with ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, unleſſe it were to uſher in a diſcovery of ſome groſſe Error or miſtake, which he had found in thoſe which he writeth againſt.</p>
               <p>But upon peruſing thoſe pages again and again, we cannot find any ſuch Error on our part; nay, we think that he hath ruſhed himſelfe into divers groſſe ſelf-contradictions.</p>
               <p>Let any indifferent Reader ſearch our former book, <hi>(Preacher Sent. p.</hi> 115.) and find out, if he can, how <hi>v.</hi> 22. is againſt us, and that expreſly in the letter. Have we either denyed Tongues to be for a ſign to them that believe not, or affirmed them to be for a ſigne to them that believe? have we aſſerted propheſying to ſerve for them that believe not, otherwiſe then the Apoſtle doth? <hi>v.</hi> 24, 25. or denyed that Prophecying ſerveth for them which believe? If not, what ſhadow of truth is there in what he faith?</p>
               <p>He telleth us we would make them believe, that the ſenſe is onely, that Propheſie was not for a ſigne to them that believed not, but for their converſion it might be. This he would have the Reader weigh a little,

               <p>Wilt thou ſay that Propheſie might not be for the converſion of them that believe not?</p>
               <p>Doth not the Apoſtle prove it might, <hi>v.</hi> 24. 25? and doth not Dr. <hi>Collings</hi> conſeſſe it, when the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever goeth into the Church Aſſembly? <hi>pag.</hi> 85. If he ſuppoſeth that we grant Propheſie to be a ſign, but not for their converſion, he is much miſtaken, he may ſee it denyed, <hi>Preacher Sent. p.</hi> 102. neither is there a ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable that way, <hi>pag.</hi> 115. to which he is now reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>We may conclude from his words, and <hi>v.</hi> 22. that it is not a ſign at all; for that verſe plainly denyeth it to be a ſigne to unbelievers; and he ſaith <hi>(pag.</hi> 84.) if it were a ſigne at all, it muſt be for them who believed not, and this confirmeth our argument, <hi>pag.</hi> 102.</p>

               <p>Whereas he ſaith <hi>(pag,</hi> 85.) <q>Prophecy is uſeful for the converſion of unbelievers, but it is when the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever comes into the Church Aſſembly, not when the Prophet goes out to them, <hi>v.</hi> 23. 24. and addeth, mark, the Prophet is tyed up to the Aſſembly of the Church in one place, and then blameth ſome for travelling up and down the countrey, and ſo <hi>pag.</hi> 73. 109.</q>

And hence, ſome who are no Officers, nor extraordinarily gifted may ordinarily Preach in publike Aſſemblies, and therefore Preaching is not an act peculiar to Office, and this anſwereth his ſecond argument, <hi>p.</hi> 90. 91.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. In our former book <hi>p.</hi> 199. we ſay diſtribution is materially an <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vind. Revind. Pag.</hi> 90.</note> act of a Deacons Office, but not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally; <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> diſtributed the Churches ſtock, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. <hi>verſ.</hi> 29. 30. <hi>yet they were no Deacons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That probationers (who are no Officers) may Preach, if it ſhould be not ordinarily but occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally, or onely once; ſeeing they will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them to Baptize ſo much as once, this is enough to prove (from their practice) that if Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing be an act peculiar to Office, yet it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, then Preaching is ſuch; and alſo that Preaching is not peculiar to Office; and ſo, his excepting them out of the queſtion cannot hinder the overthrow of his argument <hi>(pag.</hi> 92.) thereby.</p>
               <p>That proper acts <hi>quarto modo</hi> (as he ſaith theſe are, <hi>(pag.</hi> 90.) ſhould admit of ſo much as one exception, is ſtrange Logick, and as much as to ſay they are pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to Officers, and yet not peculiar to them; and therefore his exceptions <hi>(pag.</hi> 93,) cannot help him. As to, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>ver.</hi> 19, 20. We do not yet find that it was an Office-making Commiſſion, but an enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Commiſſion of Officers to other perſons, <hi>viz.</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> If a man hath two Commiſſions to the ſame work, the latter may make him an Officer to more perſons, but doth not make him more an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:116041:44"/>
then before; and his inſtance <hi>(pag.</hi> 94. about ejecting ſcandalous Miniſters by one Commiſſion in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> by another in <hi>Norwich,</hi> amounteth to no more; nor his ſecond reply <hi>(pag.</hi> 94) we may grant that this Commiſſion empowred them, yet not to be Preachers and baptizers, but to Preach to and baptize the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi> They did not of non-Preachers become Preachers by this Commiſſion, and ſuch a Commiſſion onely is to the preſent queſtion about gifted mens Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>His third reply conſiſteth partly of his meer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, and partly of what is truth, but not againſt us. The promiſe proveth that ſome in all Nations to the worlds end may warrantably be Preached unto and baptized, but it being a promiſe of Chriſts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with ſome in the work of Preaching, hence it preſuppoſeth them to be empowred to Preach before the promiſe can be theirs, and therefore cannot conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute them Preachers.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>pag.</hi> 95, 96. we were ſpeaking onely of acts of Religious worſhip, which men were warranted to perform. And is a high-way-mans pronouncing the ſame ſentence the Judge doth, allowed by the Laws of men for the ſame end that the Judges act is; as exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and admoniſhing are allowed to men out of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice by the Lawes of God for the ſame end that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers perform them? or can the ſprinkling and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing water on the face of Children, or the breaking of bread and giving it to them, be deemed any acts of Religious worſhip, or are men allowed by the Lord to perform theſe acts for the ſame ends that an Officer doth, in adminiſtering baptiſme and the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? if not, how doth this take off our anſwer about exhorting and admoniſhing? In what way and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner men out of Office may perform theſe acts, we have proved elſewhere.</p>

                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 3. As to his third Argument, from the uſeleſneſs of the Miniſterial <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vind. Revind. Pag.</hi> 96.</note> Office, as to its chief act, if this practice be allowed.</p>
               <p>We utterly deny it. The Miniſterial Office is not ſet up as to that act in vain, though many out of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice may Preach; neither doth his inſtances <hi>(pag.</hi> 99.) in Juſtices, Colonels, Captains, &amp;c. prove it. For the main end of eſtabliſhing Juſtices of the Peace is, the conſervation of the peace, which others may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour who are no Juſtices.</p>
               <p>The main act of Colonels, and Captains, and the main end for which they are eſtabliſhed is, fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with an enemy, and every common ſouldier is bound to fight even in open field as well as they, yet their Office is not ſet up in vain as to that act. If he ſhall ſay, others do not act as Juſtices in keeping the peace, or that common Souldiers do not Command a Regiment or company in fighting; we anſwer, no more do gifted men Preach to a Church as Officers, as Paſtors to it.</p>
               <p>And Reader, know that he offereth thee and us much wrong in telling thee <hi>(pag.</hi> 99.) that we ſay [the Preaching of a man in Office, is an act peculiar to Office.] If this be not ſence, the fault is his whoſe words they are.</p>
               <p>Our words may be ſeen, <hi>Preacher Sent. pag.</hi> 203. If we ſay Preaching in it ſelf is no act of Office, ſurely therein we deny ſome Preaching to be the main or chief act of Office, and ſo do ſpeak directly to his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Yet we may grant that there is Preaching which is a main and chief act of Office. Whereas he deſireth to know the difference between theſe wayes of Preaching; in the fore-cited place of our former book he may ſee it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:116041:45"/>
That which is a main act of Office is a preaching as under a ſpecial relation to them that are preached to, as being over them in the Lord, and having them committed to ones charge for feeding with the word, <hi>Act 20. v. 28. 1 Theſ. 5. 12. Heb.</hi> 13. 7. The other preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not after this manner. And this is not an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty motion (as he calleth it, <hi>pag.</hi> 102, 103) but a real difference; for, if an officer of our Church preacheth to many other Churches often, yet he is not over, nor hath the charge of many Churches committed to him, onely Epiſcopal men will aſſert that. So whoſoever preacheth to unconverted heathens and <hi>Indians,</hi> cannot (with any Scripture evidence) be ſaid to be over thoſe Infidels in the Lord, or to have them committed to his chaege; onely a Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own blood is capable of ſuch a commitment, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. and therefore it is one thing to preach, and another thing to preach as over thoſe in the Lord,—that are Preached to, and this may anſwer what he ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 102, 103. We ſay gifted men by Chriſts appointment, do the ſame acts materially, that Officers performe in their preaching, and that for thoſe ends he mentioneth of Conviction, Convertion, and Edification; yet there is a vaſt difference between their actings.</p>
               <p>And that Chriſts appointing both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhould make their authority the ſame (which he aſſerteth, <hi>Vind. Revind. pag.</hi> 102.) is ſtrange, Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, Captaines, &amp;c. may have commiſſions from one man, yet have different authorities. Another may be appointed by a maſter of a houſe to do ſome work, yet not have the ſame authority that the ſteward hath. Our Examples do plainly ſhew that different relations do empower for and lay under obligations to the ſame acts materially; and thence it followes that the belonging of ſuch acts to one relation, can be no
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:116041:45"/>
Proof that the other relation is vain, uſeleſſe, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary as to thoſe acts.</p>
               <p>The parental relation is not vain and uſeleſſe as to inſtruction, if other relations or friends be under ſome obligations to give inſtructions to the ſame children; Nor will it ſpeak the bayliffs office in a Corporation to be uſeleſſe and un-neceſſary, if the free-men may put forth ſome of the ſame Acts which they do. No more will the Lords eſtabliſhing ſtanding officers for the work of preaching or Governement (both which we mentioned, <hi>Preacher Sent. pag.</hi> 203, 204.) argue that none elſe may act herein, nor wil officers be uſeleſs and un-neceſſary as to thoſe acts, if gifted men may preach, and the Church act in government. And this anſwereth divers of his exceptions, <hi>pag.</hi> 103. 104. only we ſhall add; that his ſtraining one of our ſimilitudes to make it run on four feet, for the drawing this out of it [That gifted men may preach, or may let it a lone] and then adding many lines <hi>(pag.</hi> 103.) to diſprove what himſelfe hath wreſted out of it, is far from a canded dealing with us, eſpecially ſeeing the very words of our ſimilitude do plainly deny this ſenſe of it, and theſe words he hath concealed.</p>
               <p>Our ſimilitude runneth thus, A Chriſtian friend or neighbour may and [ought] to give gratious, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome inſtructions, &amp;c. If he had rightly applyed the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, he muſt have ſaid, ſo gifted men may and [ought] to preach,—and then he would not have uſed ſo many words to prove that they are not at their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, whether they will preach or no. Likewiſe our words are [the one is under a ſtanding obligation by the parental relation to performe ſuch acts, the other not] He giveth our words thus;</p>
               <p>The one is under a ſtanding obligation, the other not, Whereas our words do not deny friends to be under an obligation to ſuch acts, but aſſert their
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:116041:46"/>
obligation to be indifferent from that which is paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</p>
               <p>He granteth <hi>(pag.</hi> 105.) that our reaſon muſt vail to the will of God revealed in Scripture, and whether there be any ground in Scripture for the preaching of gifted men, let the Reader judge. That Apoſtles and Evangeliſts differed in nothing from Paſtors and Teachers, but in the extent of their power, which he aſſerteth <hi>(pag.</hi> 105.) we apprehend is a great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, for beſides a power of miraculous operation, they had immediate inſpirations and infalible directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the holy ſpirit.</p>
               <p>As to their being Officers, its anſwered, <hi>Preacher Sent. Pag.</hi> 209. We conclude that Apoſtles and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, and Paſtors and Teachers alſo, were needful then; but his argument ſeemeth to us to deny ſome of them to, be neceſſary in thoſe dayes. We might as well ſay, that where Paſtors and teachers were reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, there was no need of Apoſtles or Evangeliſts for preaching or ſuch ordinary acts, as he may ſay <hi>(pag.</hi> 106.) that when they were reſident in this or that particular Church, there was no need of Paſtors or Teachers, and his reaſon will be as ſtrong for us as for him, becauſe they could do all their acts.</p>
               <p>And ſurely when there were many Apoſtles at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> and Prophets at <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. though all did not ſpeak at the ſame time, yet none were un-ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, no more are gifted men. We may turn his argument, <hi>pag.</hi> 98. upon himſelfe.</p>
               <p>God doth nothing in vain.</p>
               <p>But in caſe the preaching of Officers could render it un-eceſſary for gifted men to do it, then he had done ſomething in vain; for we have proved that he hath appointed gifted men to preach, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is falſe that gifted men may not do it.</p>

of Goſpel truths to faithfull men (who ſhall be able to teach others) by Gods <hi>Timothies, 2 Tim. 2. 2. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ind. Revind. pag.</hi> 106.</p>
               <p>To what he ſaith about mens being able to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the Goſpel out of the Original into their own Tongue, we anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. We grant a knowledg of the Original to be a good help, yet its not abſolutely neceſſary, as himſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is learning in Goſpel myſtries that the Text ſpeaketh of, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>2. The things thou haſt heard of me, commit, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>As to what followeth, we ſay, it is a commitment, of the word, not of perſons; they to whom this commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was, were ſet over none thereby. It was to be committed <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The Church in other Scriptures (not Officers one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) is the object of the commitment, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 2. cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led therefore the pillar and ground of truth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If the ability be before commitment then he muſt ſay a man may be morally able to preach before Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, for <hi>id poſsumus quod jure poſſumus,</hi> and ſo his argument falleth; for the committing is not ordaining.</p>
               <p>If the ability be attained by committing thoſe things to them, Why doth he <hi>(pag.</hi> 107.) deny it to be an effect or end thereof? And ſeeing the Goſpel owneth a committing doctrinal, and this doth make men naturally able, how will it ever be proved that a morall ability is onely intended? And unleſſe that be proved, his argument is of no force; for men muſt be naturally able, before they may warrantably be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, if that were a committing of Goſpel truths to men. And that the ability is ſubſequent, is plain, [who ſhall be able—]</p>

               <p n="3">3. Men ought to commitCoſpel truths unto others, doctrinally without a certaine rule to aſſure them who ſhould be converted, ſtrengthened or comforted; and as well might he do it in this caſe, without aſſurance that every one ſhould be able; and therefore his query <hi>pag.</hi> 107. how could he know who they ſhould be? is of no concernement.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It muſt be proved not onely that ordination is neceſſary, but that it is the committing of Goſpel truths which is ſpoken of, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. or elſe this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is of no force.</p>

               <p>We do not deny that teaching publikly is intended, but how he can tell us, its meant of publike teachers, and yet ſay, the Apoſtle plainly ſpeakes <hi>de re</hi> of the thing, not <hi>de modo,</hi> of the manner of performance, <hi>Vind.

Heſpeaketh very little to our replyes unto this; we ſay the Scriptures alleadged, ſpeak of a conſtant preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he denyeth that, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 10. or <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 6. hint the leaſt of ſuch a thing.</p>
               <p>Why will he trouble the Reader with ſuch words without profit?

Or in this and the former argument, doth he intend only thus much, that the Scriptures do not ſpeak ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely of a conſtant preaching? or that 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. do not ſpeak expreſſely <hi>de modo?</hi> If this be all he ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth at, let him ſhew an expreſſe Scripture to prove that all preachers muſt be ordained, or that none may preach without ordination, or elſe give over ſuch ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guings.</p>
               <p>His <hi>minor</hi> indeed was neither true in the matter or for me; he faith <hi>(pag.</hi> 109.) It is true (by a ſlip of his pen) inſtead of the Church to which they preach, he put in the Church in which they are, but it is the ſame thing; for admit that they may Prophecy, he proved before (he faith) from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 23. that they had no warrant to goe out of their Church to do it.</p>
               <p>To which we anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He that is ſo ſubject to falſe Logick himſelf, might be more cautious of accuſing others, eſpecially without ground.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This which he calleth but a ſlip of his pen, was the very thing which his argument had dependance upon, and falleth with; let any peruſe his former book <hi>(Vind. pag.</hi> 40.) and they will find it ſo; for he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth whether any will ſay—<q>that a Church is tyed up to that duty, which no Church is able to perform.</q>

               <p>So that his argument taketh its force from their inability to maintain them in the Church where they are.

His aſſertion which he groundeth that concluſion upon, <hi>viz.</hi> their not being warranted to goe out of the Church to Prophecy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 23, we diſproved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but how he is conſiſtent with himſelf, in aſſerting theſe Prophets to be extraordinary officers <hi>(pag.</hi> 65) and yet to be confined in their exerciſe to a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church <hi>(pag.</hi> 73. 85. 109.) we know not.</p>

               <p>Becauſe many build ſo much upon that place, we inſiſted largely upon it, he replyeth very little to what we ſay, but bringeth an Argument to prove, that gifted men, as gifted, are not ſent, and it riſeth to this,</p>
               <p>They are neither immediately, nor mediately ſent, <hi>Ergo</hi> not at all.</p>
               <p>He concludeth that we muſt ſay, they are ſent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately; for if it be mediately, it muſt be by his Church, commanding, Electing or Ordaining.</p>
               <p>If it be immediately, then by Chriſts own voyce, or by a ſign from heaven; but he faith we have found out two others wayes. 1. By his revealed will in his word. 2. By his providence, &amp;c <hi>vind. Revind. pag.</hi> 112.</p>

an immediate miſſion. We uſe theſe words [it is not an immediate miſſion, but mediate, by the word] <hi>Preacher Sent. pag.</hi> 130.</p>
               <p>2. Gods commanding men to Preach, is his ſending, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14. <hi>ver.</hi> 14. 15. <hi>I ſent them not, what is that? neither have I commanded them.</hi> His not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding is his not ſending; therefore his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is his ſending, ſo <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. Chriſts commanding them [go Preach] is his ſending. We have proved that gifted menare commanded to preach, and that proves that God ſends them by his word.</p>
               <p>Let him prove that Ordaining or any act of a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery is Gods ſending, unleſſe in the ſence we men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>Preach. Sent. pag.</hi> 137. which will not at all ſerve his purpoſe, becauſe no Authority to Preach is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by the miſſion we there ſpeak of.</p>
               <p>We do not ſay, that Gods commanding men in his written word to believe, repent, &amp;c. is called ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet ſuch commands in the word, are mediate Calls to ſuch works, though no men ſhould urge ſuch duties upon thoſe that are to perform them. So, his commanding gifted men to Preach, by his word, is a mediate Call, and his ſaying by that word, go, is a mediate miſſion, though no Presbytery by Ordination or otherwiſe faith go.</p>
               <p>3. That ſending makes them Officers we deny. That no man can ſend another, but he is in Office, as to that whereabout he is ſent, in a large ſence we grant; but that ſending ſetteth men over thoſe to whom they are ſent, or maketh them Officers in a ſtrict ſence, we utterly deny; neither doth any thing he faith <hi>(pag.</hi> 113.) prove it. The Kings Ambaſſadour is his officer in the former, but not in the latter ſence, for every Officer properly ſo is ſuperiour to thoſe that are the object or terminus of his Office, ſo are not Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours unto them to whom they are ſent, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:116041:49"/>
unleſſe the miſſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10 15. could be proved to be Ordination, the Argument thence cometh to nothing.</p>
               <p>And many more words are ſpent about the travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of <hi>Paul</hi> and others from place to place, and many other matters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alſo which were no greater Goſpel myſteries then this, though it be underſtood of a miſſion of thoſe who before were made Preachers, and not of an office-making miſſion, eſpecially ſeeing their ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which was a thing in thoſe dayes, ſo much queſtioned by the <hi>Jews.</hi>

               <p>His other exceptions <hi>(pag.</hi> 114.) againſt a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential ſending, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That none can run before they be ſent. 2. That then the creep. houſes, 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 3. 6. were ſent, muſt needs be vain; ſeeing in the ſame page he confeſſeth that we do not own a bare providential ſending, without a command by the word.</p>
               <p>4. What he ſaith <hi>(Vind. Revind. p.</hi> 115.) giveth no evidence that Ordination is the miſſion intended.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the command of God in his word is ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we have proved. And that <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 3. cannot in the leaſt prove Ordination to be miſſion, he might have ſeen proved, <hi>Preacher Sent. pag.</hi> 253 254.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Ordination of Officers by a Church to it ſelf cannot ſtrictly be called ſending, proveth that Ordination is not miſſion. If as in the caſe of Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, <hi>Act</hi> 6. there may be Ordination without miſſion, then theſe are ſeparable each from other, and ſo are not the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 115. He ſaith the miſſion mentioned, <hi>Mat. 10. ver.</hi> 5. 6. 7. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. was extraordinary miſſion. It is true, they had it immediately from the mouth of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> men in theſe dayes mediately, and ſo the way is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, but the miſſion may be the ſame ſtill. Chriſt by his own voyce commanded his Diſciples to watch, <hi>Mat. 24. ver.</hi> 42. and 25. 13 and 26. <hi>ver.</hi> 41. and the ſame
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:116041:49"/>
which were immediate commands to them, are medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate commands to us to watch, and the watching is the ſame, and ſo may the miſſion then and now be the ſame. And if <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. were not the ſame miſſion that others have now, why doth he alleadge that place to prove Preaching and Baptizing in the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. <hi>Vind. pag. 35. Vind. Revind. pag.</hi> 92. 94. and ſay that it doth eſtabliſh a conſtant Office of the Miniſtry to the worlds end? And to be ſure the Apoſtles miſſion was not Ordination.</p>
               <p>As for a miſſion to the whole Catholick Church, which he ſpeaketh of, <hi>p.</hi> 117. it is an unſcriptural noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and no reaſon being produced to countenance it, we ſhould but waſte paper to multiply words about it; and this is our anſwer to his fifth chapter.</p>

               <p>OUr argument, from the preaching of <hi>Apollo</hi> is ſuch as ſpiritual weapons being wanting to fight with it, he is fleeing to the carnal weapons of bitter words, and ſeeketh that way to prevail againſt it.</p>
               <p>We had occaſion to ſay that the baptiſm of <hi>Iohn</hi> &amp; the baptiſm of Chriſt are diſtinguiſhed each from other. Hereupon he ſaith <hi>(pag.</hi> 118.) This argument (as to the matter of it) is purely Popiſh and falſe, as to the forme of it, and its uſage in this caſe is primarily Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian; as to both, falſe, and no way concluſive. And di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe arguments he bringeth to prove <hi>Iohns</hi> baptiſme and <hi>Chriſts</hi> to be the ſame; We grant they are the ſame in kind, they are not two Baptiſmes, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:116041:50"/>
ſo all his Arguments are needleſs and concern not us.</p>
               <p>But that the baptiſme of <hi>John</hi> is (as we ſaid) diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the Baptiſme of Chriſt, is generally aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by Proteſtant writers, and may appear,</p>

From the non-appointment either of Ordination, or of thoſe Officers which are to be Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, until after the Baptiſme of <hi>John;</hi> it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to know by <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſme that there ſhould be Paſtors and Teachers, or that they ſhould receive ſuch an Ordination: the inſtitution for theſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices did not come until afterward, and are onely to be found amongſt the Doctrines of Chriſt, and ſo prove a difference between the Baptiſmes, let any ſhew an inſtitution for theſe amongſt any of the doctrines of <hi>John,</hi> otherwiſe, <hi>Act. 18 ver. 25. Apollo's</hi> Preaching when he knew onely the Baptiſme of <hi>John</hi> (which did give no knowledge of Ordination) is a full proof, that

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Our Argument is the ſame that the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters uſe; onely we apply it to election, they to Ordination, as may be ſeen <hi>Preach. Sent. pag.</hi> 224. And therefore it is no certain Argument for them, if it be not for us.</p>
               <p>2. The main (if not the only) argument for Church Government by Claſſical, Provincial, National and oecumenical Aſſemblies, is taken from the leſs to the greater Affimatively; and many things ſpeak it to be invalid and non-concluſive in that caſe, which cannot be alleadged in this.</p>
               <p>Thus they argue from, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. ſee Anſwer. of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemb. <hi>pag.</hi> 178.</p>

               <p>And muſt it not needs be a certain Argnment when thoſe pleaded for are undoubtedly inveſted with power to put forth the ſame act (not diſtributing onely, but collectively and) in the ſame manner, and when an inſtituted relation cannot be introduced, nor the ends of it in an ordinary way be attained without the act, and when other grounds and reaſons are more ſtrong for exerting the acts towards the greater then towards the leſs?</p>
               <p>And this is the caſe in the preſent Argument, for the people in a Church are certainly inveſted with power to chooſe Deacons, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. and election is Eſſential (as we have elſewhere proved) unto the Paſtoral relation, and ſo it cannot be without it, neither in an ordinary way could there be a free ſubmiſſion to, or a receiving edification by ſuch Paſtors as are impoſed upon a people, which being matters more eſpecially of ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concernment, do ſpeak the grounds to be more ſtrong, for a Churches chooſing Paſtors, who are the greater, then Deacons who are the leſs.</p>
               <p>Object. 4. <hi>The height of argument from this Text is, It is probable——And we ſay it is not probable. 1.

               <p>And if it were, that renders it as improbable that any Officers now ſhould judge of a mans abilities ſo

                  </gap> to chooſe officers by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages, is never in Scripture given to the Officers, and is undoubtedly given to the people, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> The powe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to chooſe officers by ſuffrages, cannot be the act of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> only.</p>
               <p>And whether this be a begging the queſtion, or a proving what we aſſert, let the Reader judge. He bids us <hi>(Vind. Revind. pag.</hi> 131.) ſee if there be one word in the Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy</hi> or <hi>Titus</hi> for the peoples choice.</p>
               <p>We turne it upon himſelfe, let him ſee if there be one word in thoſe Epiſtles for the officers choice, or for the giving the power of election unto Officers. What he addeth <hi>(Vind. Revind. pag.</hi> 132 133.) is to deny that every particular Church is able to judge of the abilities of a Miniſter.</p>
               <p>We have proved their ability from <hi>Iohn 10. v.</hi> 4. 5. See <hi>Preacher Sent. pag.</hi> 225. 237.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob. 1. How can they judge if a Minister be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince againſaying Socinian, or Arminian, or Papiſt, who know not what any of them hold? Vind. Revind. pag.</hi> 132.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is poſſible for thoſe to judge whether a man be able to convince gainſayers, who knowes not what many of them hold: The Biſhops or Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters, who were adminiſtrators of Ordination in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> 10. 20. 30. or 40 years ago, could not know what <hi>Quakers</hi> and other blaſphemers would hold, yet ſurely he will not ſay that they could not judge whether thoſe which they Ordained were able to convince gainſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: And why may not a Church as well be able
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:116041:58"/>
to judge of a Miniſters ability to convince gainſayers, though it knoweth not what <hi>Socinians</hi> or <hi>Arminians</hi> hold?</p>
               <p>2. Although ſome Church members know not er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors by the name of <hi>Socinians,</hi> &amp;c. yet if they hear them broached, they are able to judge that they are contrary to ſound doſtrine.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe which turne from the faithful word in matters fundamental, as they are unfit to judge of a Miniſters qualifications, ſo they are not duely qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be Church members.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob. 2. What belongs to Chriſts Sheep, as Chriſts ſheep, belongs to every ſheep, but this doth not belong to every ſheep of Christ. Ergo,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I hope our bretheren will not ſay, this belongs to the woman, yet are they Chriſts ſheep too.—Nor that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man hath ability; if they do and will give us leave, we will pick them out Twenty out of every hundred, &amp;c. <hi>Vind. Revind. pag.</hi> 133.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If it doth not belong to every ſheep of Chriſt to judge of miniſterial ability, yet the reaſon may be, becauſe ſome want a word or inſtitution of Chriſt to empower-them thereunto, as in the caſe of women; not becauſe they want ability, about which the preſent queſtion is.</p>
               <p>2. It muſt belong to every ſheep of Chriſt, if <hi>Iohn 10. v.</hi> 5. reacheth ſo far as he concludeth it doth, <hi>pag.</hi> 133. For ſuch ſheep as are hearers, are there aſſerted to have both ability and liberty to judge what teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers they are to follow, and who they are to avoid.</p>
               <p>That one ſold, <hi>v.</hi> 16. is one ſpecifically, Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles have one kind of Church order, not one Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically, all do not make up one Church of Churches.</p>
               <p>But how he can reconcile his owne expreſſions upon this Text, and make them agree in one, we know not; for he telleth us,</p>
               <p>
                  <table>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:116041:58"/>

                        <cell>The Text ſaith, my ſheep, not my fold; what is here made to belong to ſheep, belongs to every ſheep, <hi>Vind. Revind. pag.</hi> 133.</cell>
                        <cell>If our Brethren ſay, the Text is to be underſtood of Chriſts ſheep as folded together in the Church, we grant what they ſay, but ſay it is meant of the one fold, <hi>ver.</hi> 16.</cell>

               <p>Doth not one of the expreſſions deny it to be Chriſts fold, and the other grant it to be his fold, that is there intended?</p>
               <p>3.

               </argument>
               <p>THere came lately to our hands, a Book entituled, <hi>A moderate enquiry into the warrantableneſs of the preaching of gifted and unordained perſons,</hi> written by Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> at the deſire and appointment of the Provincial Aſſembly of <hi>London;</hi> in way of reply to ſome part of our Book, intituled, <hi>The Preacher Sent.</hi> We ſhall give ſome brief <hi>animadverſions</hi> upon the moſt conſiderable
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:116041:59"/>
paſſages of his Book, and ſo leave it to the Reader to judge between us.</p>
               <p>The Provincial Aſſemblies definition of Office is this, The Office of the Miniſtry is a ſpiritual relation to the whole employment of the Miniſtry, in a Perſon qualified, founded upon a ſpecial and regular Call, <hi>Jus Div. Min. pag.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>This we excepted againſt, becauſe either it altogether omiteth or elſe determineth employment to be the correlate unto this relation, and either way it is very faulty. For, it is groſſely to ſwarve from the right Rules of a definition, to omit the correlate in defining a particular relation, which is Eſſential to the thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined; even themſelves ſay, that Relatives cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the one without the other, <hi>Jus Divin. Min. p.</hi> 2. we infer, <hi>Ergo</hi> they cannot be defined aright, the one without the other.</p>
               <p>And there is nothing in their definition to be the correlate, unleſs it be [employment,] and that this cannot be it, our four Arguments do evidence, <hi>Preacher Sent. pag.</hi> 5. 6. 7.</p>
               <p>So that Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> may ſee that our Arguments were not onely brought to batter down one expreſſion brought in, onely <hi>obiter</hi> and occaſionally as he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth, <hi>pag.</hi> 3. but to diſcover a very conſiderable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or imperfection in their definition, which was made more obvious by that expreſſion.</p>
               <p>He ſaith <hi>(pag.</hi> 3.) it was not the deſign of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly to deny the Miniſtry to be a relation to a Church, nor was it their buſineſs accurately to inſiſt upon the notions of relate and correlate; they never called the work of the Miniſtry the correlate, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>obiter</hi> they aſſerted the Office of the Miniſtry to be better defined, by relation to the work, then to a particular Church, which he ſaith we have not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:116041:59"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We ſpeak nothing of an accurate inſiſting on the notions of relate and correlate, but we ſay, it is a falſe definition of a particular relation, if nothing be aſſerted as the correlate, and therefore their not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying a Church, nor aſſerting work to be the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, will not help, unleſs they had affirmed and proved ſomething elſe to be it.</p>
               <p>Our proving (in the ſecond queſtion) a particular Church onely to be the correlate, is enough to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove that expreſſion; for Office muſt needs be better defined by its reference to its correlate, then by its end.</p>
               <p>His inſtance about a King <hi>(pag.</hi> 3.) cannot ſalve the buſineſs; For it were very improper to ſay, the Office of a King is a relation to Ruling, and to give this as the definition of that; and as abſurd were it to ſay, that the Office of a King is better defined by Ruling, then by relation to his Subjects or Kingdom; and it is not paralel unleſſe it runneth us. And ſo it is abſurd to ſay that the abſtract Miniſtry is better defined by relation to the work, then to a particular Church; for we have proved that ſuch a Church is the correlate, work not ſo, but onely the end.</p>
               <p>That office is a predicamental, and not a <hi>Tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendal</hi> or <hi>nominal</hi> relation, and that a potential being is not ſufficient in ſuch a relation, he may ſee in our reply to <hi>Dr. Collings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to clear the matter more fully, and make way for the next queſtion, as a clew leading the right way out of this controverſie, we ſhall give this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The terms Office and Officer may be taken large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or ſtrickly, in a general or a ſpecial ſence.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In an general ſence, there is an Officer to man, and the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or work it ſelf is the Office wherein one man doth ſerve another: thus a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n may be an Officer from an inferiour to a ſuperiour, or from one
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:116041:60"/>
equal to another, and have no relation proper or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicamental growing thereupon. In this large ſenſe, gifted men preaching, yea any Church-members ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing any gift, or doing any work for the profit of the body or Church, may be called officers, and the work an Office, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 4. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is tranſlated Office.</p>
               <p>But this is an Officer without Rule or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of whom in this controverſy we ſpeak not: In this ſenſe, though Apoſtles or others be conſidered as Officers to heathens, it doth not at all contradict us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In a ſpecial ſenſe there is an officer over man: as a Prince over his ſubjects, a maſter over his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, ſo a paſtor over his flock; this is an officer with power of Rule and Government.</p>
               <p>Whenſoever the Scripture ſpeaketh of Office or Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, notified by the Titles of Paſtor, Teacher, Elder, or Biſhop, they are taken thus, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13. 7. 17. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 12. And thus we conſtantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered it in our former book called, <hi>The Preacher Sent.</hi> In this ſenſe Apoſtles were not officers, nor did preach as Officers to the heathens; they had no power of Rule or Governement over them, 1 <hi>Corin. 5. 12. What have I to do to judge thoſe that are without?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt. Whether officers ſtand in relation (as officers) to a particular Church onely?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We hold the affirmative part; Mr <hi>Poole</hi> would have them officers to the whole Church, <hi>(pag.</hi> 6. 7. &amp;c.) by which we ſuppoſe he intendeth a Church Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like viſible.</p>
               <p>To his premiſes and preamble we ſay,</p>
               <p>The Judgement of Churches is not our Rule, but the Scripture, &amp; we can find no ſuch Synods as he ſpeaketh of there. <hi>Acts</hi> 15. holdeth forth that one Church may ſend meſſengers in difficult caſes to an other Church
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:116041:60"/>
as <hi>Antioch</hi> did there to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for help and council, but it cannot be proved that any acts of Government were there put forth, towards any abſent Churches, and therefore this is no warrant for provincial or Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenical Synods.</p>
               <p>We wiſh that all differences in judgement amongſt the Saints were at an end, but we are not to ſilence a truth of Chriſt, becauſe ſome deare friends are diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, neither is the difference between congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal brethren ſo great in this point as he ſuppoſeth, We do not obtrude our Notions upon the world, but have publiſhed our perſwaſions with our grounds, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring that they may be weighed in the ballance of the Sanctuary, and that either others may receive light from us, or we from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Premiſe,</hi> 1. He premiſeth <hi>(pag.</hi> 6.) a Miniſter may be a Miniſter to the whole Church, 1. <hi>Actu Secundo,</hi> actually, immediately, abſolutely, and independent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Actu primo,</hi> habitually, aptitudinally, mediately conditionally &amp; dependingly, ſo that he hath a <hi>jus</hi> or power to teach every where, but may not exerciſe that <hi>jus</hi> or power every where, but by the conſent of the Church or Rulers, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To aſſert an habituall Miniſter or Officer, ſeemeth to us no better then to aſſert an habitual King, Juſtice, Conſtable, or an habitual husband, Father, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To be habitually and conditionally a Miniſter to a Church, and to be no miniſter to it, is all one.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Miniſters have a <hi>jus</hi> or power to teach every where Office-wiſe, is not proved; the place al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged, [go preach the Goſpel to every creature] in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth the exerciſe of the power, and ſo muſt prove that they ought to exerciſe their power every where, if it were to his purpoſe; but the Scriptures frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:116041:61"/>
witneſſe, and himſelfe confeſſeth that they may not exerciſe that power but by the conſent of the Church or Rulers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That any unblameable Officers of Chriſt ſhould be iuſtly hindred from the exerciſe of all Office-power, or have none that they can (in Chriſts order) exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe it upon, whilſt the Office-power continueth upon them, in a ſtrange paradox: For all that have Office<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power, are actually and immediately under a command of Chriſt to do office-work; as thoſe Scriptures which ſpeak of the duty of Officers do abundantly teſtifie; and ſo Chriſt ſhould command the ſame perſons, at the ſame time, to do, and yet not to do Office-work, and then Chriſts commands ſhould claſh one with an other. Now ſuppoſe ſuch an Officer hath no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar flock, and all Churches and Rulers deny their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, either from their being full of Officers, or upon other lawful accounts; in this caſe he will be juſtly hindred from the exerciſe of all office-power, and hath none that he can exerciſe it upon; for Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth <hi>(p.</hi> 6.) he may not exerciſe the power, but by the conſent of the Church or Rulers.</p>
               <p>We might ſhew many other inconveniencies that the aſſerting officrs to have a habitual power over a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church, draw along with it, but we forbear, ſaying onely this; It doth not looke like the order of Chriſt, that a Miniſters power ſhould extend to the Catholike Church, when it is impoſſible that he ſhould ever exerciſe that power (it may be) to the thouſand part of that Church; nay, when he is by divine right fixed in a particular Church, the reſiding in which, forbiddeth his traveling to do acts of Office to the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Premiſ.</hi> 2. He premiſeth <hi>(pag.</hi> 7.) that a general reſpect to the whole Church is not inconſiſtent with a peculiar reſpect to ſome one Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:116041:61"/>
This he illuſtrateth by an inſtance of a vaſt number of ſheep, which twenty ſhepherds are choſen to look unto; and by the <hi>German</hi> Empire, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. We deny that there is ſuch a whole Church as he ſuppoſeth, for which denyal we have given rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons elſe where. And let the Reader take notice once for all, that when ever we ſpeak as if there were ſuch a whole Church or Catholike Church, we onely ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, but do not grant it in his ſenſe.</p>
               <p>2. Suppoſe there were ſuch a Church, we denie that any inſtitution of <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath determined ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry officers to have a general reſpect (as Officers) to the whole Church; and ſo his infrances of a vaſt number of ſheep, and the Empire come to nothing.</p>
               <p>3 A peculiar reſpect to ſome one Church is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the ſame relation to an other: for, nothing is peculiar but that which is appropriated; <hi>Iſrael</hi> was Gods peculiar people, that is, his onely.</p>
               <p>As to his inſtance about ſheep, we ſay, If the Maſter of the ſheep chooſeth the twenty ſhepherds, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth the whole number of ſheep to them, then the actual care of every ſheep is upon every one; and if but one ſheep be loſt, every ſhepherd will fall under blame, neither will the diſtributing the ſheep into twenty parcels (though ſome be careful of their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels) excuſe any from blame, the diſtribution or diviſion being the act of the Shepherds (according to his infrance) not the Act of the Maſter. If the catholike Church were thus committed to officers, then every Officer would be blameable for the wandrings of any one member of that Church, though their habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations were thouſands of miles diſtant each from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath committed onely a particular Church or flock of his ſheep, to the charge of any one of his officers; and if others, not of a mans own flock,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:116041:62"/>
do miſcarry, his not ſeeking their reducement to the utmoſt of his ability and opportunity, is a ſin againſt charity, but not againſt his office according to any Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple rule that yet we can find. The Angel of the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> is not rebaked for the miſcarriages of the Church of <hi>Smyrna;</hi> nor is the Angel of the Church of <hi>Smyrna</hi> reproved for the ſins of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> or <hi>Thyatira,</hi> or <hi>Sardis, Revel.</hi> 2, and 3. but every Angel is reproved for the ſins of that particular Church which he was ſet over.</p>
               <p>As to his inſtance of the <hi>German</hi> Empire <hi>(page</hi> 8.) we ſay it hath a vaſt diſparity in it to the caſe in hand, For there are no acts to be performed in the Church (to make a double relation neceſſary) anſwerable to thoſe in the Empire.</p>
               <p>If no Emperours were to be choſen, or acts of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral concernement to the whole Empire, as ſuch, to be exerted, thoſe Princes or Electors would not ſuſtain any ſuch general relation to the whole Empire: and there being no univerſal Church-officer to be choſen, or any acts of inſtituted worſhip to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, which are peculiar to a univerſal Church, as ſuch, hence the caſes are vaſtly different, and alſo it is very improbable that ſuch an order ſhould be of <hi>Chriſts</hi> appointment. They have not one by Syſteme of Lawes, neither are theſe Electors or Princes intruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a joint-power for the ordinary government of the whole, but every free Prince hath power to make what Lawes he will, and if he will allow every congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational Church as entire a power within it ſelfe, as every of thoſe Princes hath within his own Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, we ſuppoſe no power beyond that will belong to any but <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob. The Apostles were Paſtors of the whole Church, yet the work was divided among them, and they undertook aſpeciall relation to ſome particular parts, as</hi> Peter <hi>to the</hi>

               <p>2. The Apoſtles had immediate directions from the Lord where to labour in the work of their office, <hi>Act. 13. 4. Act. 16. 9.

He that wrought effectually in <hi>Peter</hi> to the Apoſtleſhip of the circumciſion, the ſame was mighty in me towards the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> The Lords making ſuch a diviſion (if it were one) was ſufficient to give them a diſpenſation for acting in Office-work elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, until freſh inſtructions came.</p>
               <p>But ordinary Officers have no ſuch directions from the Lord, or any thing equivalent to them, and ſo are obliged to perform acts of Office to all Churches in the world, and ſin if they do not, (according to him) for they have no diſpenſation from the Lord for acting in any, and without that, they muſt act to the utmoſt bounds of their relation.</p>
               <p>3. Apoſtles were not ſo limited and confined in their Office, unto thoſe which eſpecially were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them, as ordinary Officers are to their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches: the Goſpel of the uncircumciſion was committed to <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Goſpel of the circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion unto <hi>Peter, Gal. 2. v.</hi> 7. but yet <hi>Paul</hi> (to uſe Mr. <hi>Pools</hi> words though improper) was actually, immediately and abſolutely an officer at the ſame time to the <hi>Jews,</hi> hence he is often executing his office amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> as <hi>Act. 21. ver.</hi> 15. 17. 18. &amp;c. And he ſaith expreſſely, the care of all the Churches was upon him dayly, 2 <hi>Cor. 11. ver. 28. Ergo,</hi> He had an actual relation to the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> as well as the <hi>Gentile</hi> Churches, even to all the Churches, and ſo no double relation did ariſe by
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:116041:63"/>
his being the Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> but as a father having many children with families of their own, may abide and continue longer with ſome of them then with others, yet ſtandeth in the ſame relation of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to all. So the Apoſtles though they did abide more with ſome Churches then with others, yet no diſtinct relation was introduced thereby, and therefore this inſtance of the Apoſtles is nothing to his purpoſe; For, the relation of ordinary Officers to a particular Church is ſuch, that if they had a relation to a Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church, it would not be the ſame but another, and ſo diſtinct, that themſelves aſſert a double rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that one <hi>(viz.</hi> that to the Church Univerſal) laſteth, though his particular relation ceaſeth, <hi>Jus Divin. Min. p.</hi> 151.</p>
               <p>Neither doth it appear that all the Apoſtles had ſome Churches more eſpecially aſſigned to them, then others, and thoſe that had not, muſt needs be (as he phraſeth it) actually, and equally related to all Churches, and without any ſuch double relation, but were obliged to travel from one Church to another; where as ordinary officers are fixed in their particular Churches, and obliged to abide there. Mr. <hi>Poole (p.</hi> 9.) taketh notice of a remarkable difference between Teaching and Ruling, in point of the poſſibility of the thing, and the edification of the Church (which (he ſaith) is the great rule in all Church adminiſtrations) for a Miniſter may joyntly with others rule a far greater proportion then he can teach:—-he taketh notice that the Apoſtles could not teach every Church, yet did actually rule all the Churches at leaſt which are mentioned, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The queſtion is not, whether there be a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of a Miniſters ruling more then he can te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap> but whether by Chriſts appointment a Miniſter is to undertake the Ruling of more then he can teach, or o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

more then a particular Church? we can find no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Chriſt for any ſuch thing, and without that, edification will not be a rule ſufficient to warrant the acting in Church-adminiſtrations, when every thing may lawfully be done that is poſſible to be done, then this arguing will be good.</p>
               <p>2. It is not proved that any act of Rule, or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was put forth, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. and there is no ſyllable of proof, that the Apoſtles power of Government was more extenſive then their teaching power, ſo much as in the exerciſe of it.</p>
               <p>He proceedeth to lay down ſome Arguments to prove, that Miniſters are Officers, and act as officers, to more then their own particular Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 1. If Miniſters are Officers, and act as Officers towards conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Poole p.</hi> 10.</note> heathens, then they are no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers onely to their particular congregations. But Miniſters are Officers and act as Officers towards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible heathens.</p>
               <p>To prove his Minor he ſaith. 1. That Apoſtles were conſtituted Officers before the viſible Goſpel Church was erected, is undeniable. 2 Such are clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed, <hi>Mat. 28. ver.</hi> 19, 20. to be the primary and immediate object of the Apoſtical Office and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. There were multitudes baptized by <hi>John,</hi> before the Apoſtles were conſtituted Officers, <hi>Mat. 3. ver.</hi> 5, 6. and either there muſt be ſome viſible Goſpel Church then erected, to which theſe Baptized perſons were related, and then his Argument is untrue; or elſe that muſt be a truth which he calleth a monſtrous paradox <hi>(pag. 28.) viz.</hi> That Baptiſm doth not admit, or make a man to ſtand in relation to any Church; for they were members of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church before, and ſo were not admitted into that by their Baptiſm,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:116041:64"/>
and if no Goſpel Church was at this time erected, then their Baptiſm did not admit them into any Church at all.</p>
               <p>2. Many did viſibly ſtand in relation to Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtles were conſtituted Officers, or had that miſſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. therefore either his Argument, <hi>p.</hi> 29. muſt be falſe, or elſe this his poſition. <hi>p.</hi> 10. that Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were conſtituted Officers before the viſible Goſpel Church was erected, cannot be true, of which he ſaith, its a plain caſe and undeniable.</p>
               <p>3. If the Eſſence of the Church had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Apoſtles in caſe all converted Chriſtians had dyed (as he ſuppoſed, <hi>pag.</hi> 10.) how can he deny the Church to have a being, the Apoſtles having a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in whom (he ſaith) the Eſſence of the Church was?</p>
               <p>4. We deſire our diſtinction formerly mentioned may be remembred: we grant the Apoſtles were, and others are, in a general ſence, Officers to heathens: but we deny that they were, or that others are, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers to heathens in a ſpecial ſence, namely as over them in the Lord; and this anſwereth his ſuppoſition, <hi>pag.</hi> 10. of Chriſtians dying and none remaining to be Preached to but heathens, and alſo taketh off his charge againſt us in the ſame page, for denying Apoſtles to be Officers unto heathens.</p>
               <p>5. Apoſtles were extraordinary officers; our queſtion is onely about ordinary Officers, and therefore all he ſaith is beſide the queſtion. If Apoſtles were before the viſible Goſpel Church was erected, and if Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles acted as Officers towards convertible heathens, yet ſeeing they were extraordinary Officers, it will not follow thence, that ordinary Officers act as Officers towards convertible heathens.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Apoſtles and Paſtors are parallel'd in this caſe,</hi> Epheſ. 4. verſ. 11. 12. <hi>&amp;c. the body of Christ in its latitude
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:116041:64"/>
is the correlatum or the object of the paſtoral Office: but the body of Chriſt includes heathens; Therefore heathens to be converted are the object and correlate of the paſtoral office. That heathens are a part of Chriſts body, he thinketh evident, they are called his ſheep,</hi> Joh. 10. <hi>ver. 16. he laid down his life for them, which he did onely for his body,</hi> Eph. 5. &amp;c. <hi>Mr.</hi> Poole, <hi>pag.</hi> 12. 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If by the body of Chriſt, <hi>Eph. 4. ver.</hi> 11. 12. we muſt (as Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 12.) neceſſarily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the whole collection of all Chriſts members in all ages of the Church, all which, in Scripture phraſe, go to the making up of Chriſts body, &amp;c. then it is the myſtical body of Chriſt that is intended, conſiſting of the whole number of the elect, redeemed, juſtified, or ſanctified ones, and theſe onely.</p>
               <p>And if the body of Chriſt includeth heathens and viſibly unconverted ones (as Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> ſuppoſeth it doth here) then it muſt be taken in this ſence; but that miniſters ſhould be Officers, or act as officers to this myſtical body of Chriſt, is a ſtrange paradox; For, all the elect and called ones which lived before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt in the fleſh, and all the Saints in heaven, and all the elect unborn, as well as thoſe living in this or that age of the world, belong to this body of Chriſt. And now we ſhall turn his Argument upon himſelf.</p>
               <p>The body of Chriſt in its latitude is the <hi>correlatum,</hi> or the object of the Paſtoral Office; but the body of Chriſt includes all the elect which lived before Chriſts coming in the fleſh (and ſo before the Paſtoral Office was inſtituted) and all the Saints in heaven, yea hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, even all the elect unborn; <hi>Ergo,</hi> all the elect which lived before Chriſts coming in the fleſh (and ſo before the Paſtoral office was inſtituted) and all the Saints in heaven, yea heathens, and all the elect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, are the object and correlate of the Paſtoral Office.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:116041:65"/>
Who wil not eaſily ſee the weakneſſe of this argument: for many members of this body, were in heaven thouſands of years before any were inveſted with the Paſtoral Office on Earth, and ſurely they were not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers to thoſe who were in heaven, they had no need of their officr. If body be taken in this ſenſe, his <hi>major</hi> is apparently falſe. The body of Chriſt in its latitude is not the correlatum or object of the paſtoral office. 2. If it be underſtood of the viſible body of <hi>Chr.</hi> then his <hi>minor</hi> is falſe; The body of Chriſt, i. e. his viſible Church or body, doth not include heathens to be converted.</p>
               <p>Even the Text he alleadgeth evidenceth ſo much, <hi>Iohn 10. v.</hi> 16. other ſheep I have; its true thoſe were Gentiles, heathens ſheep by election; but it is added, [which are not of this fold] which witneſſeth that heathens (though ſheep by predeſtination) yet are not folded into the viſible Church of Chriſt. It would be an unſcriptural and an abominable aſſertion to ſay, that heathens are members or a part of Chriſts viſible body or Church, which onely is the correlate of the paſtoral office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. The ſecond argument is taken from 2 <hi>Corin.</hi> 5. 20. where the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Pool p.</hi> 13.</note> world, which conſiſts of ſuch as are yet without, and no members of the Church, are made the chief objects and correlatum of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>To whom Miniſters act as Ambaſſadors, to them they act as officers: But Miniſters preach as Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to heathens convertible, and to be converted. <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> His aſſumption, he ſaith is evident for the termes, to be an Ambaſſador is nothing el<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1. Firſt the ſcripture makes no difference between a Miniſters preaching to his own Church, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Ergo,</hi> there is no difference.</p>

                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:116041:65"/>
2. Even heathens are bound to hear Miniſters preaching to them, and that not onely <hi>ex vi materiae,</hi> becauſe of the matter they treat of, but <hi>virtute mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neris,</hi> by vertue of their Office, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 16. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. We deny his Major, Miniſters may act as Ambaſſadors to them, they do not act as officers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in a ſpecial ſenſe: and it is obſerveable that as the word <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>So if gifted men, or other Miniſters carry the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Goſpel to heathens, and the reconcila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble world, upon a command of Chriſt to goe with it, they act as Ambaſſadors, yet not as Officers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
               <p>2. As to his <hi>minor,</hi> in a general ſenſe we grant that Miniſters preach as Ambaſſadors to Heathens, i. e. as thoſe that are warranted or commanded by Chriſt to do a meſſage of peace to them, but in a ſtrict ſenſe they do not act as offfcers unto heathens.</p>
               <p>As to his proofs of his <hi>minor,</hi> we ſay</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Scripture concludeth that an officer doth preach as a Paſtor, Biſhop, or overſeer to his owne Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. as over it in the Lord, 1 <hi>Theſ. 5. v.</hi> 12. it no where ſaith that he preacheth under any ſuch relation to others, it lyeth upon Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> to prove it, if he will aſſert it: it were ſtrange unſcriptural language to ſay, that God hath made officers overſeers
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:116041:66"/>
to Heathens, or ſet them over them; where are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens called a mans flock? If they were the object or correlate of the paſtoral office they muſt be ſo, for Paſtor and flock are Relatives; and Ambaſſadors (if in office) are the ſame Officers, under an other name.</p>
               <p>And this anſwereth his firſt particular, <hi>(pag.</hi> 14.) and proveth that the Scripture makes a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Miniſters preaching to his own Church and to others; for it concludeth his being in ſuch a relation to his own Church, as he ſtands not in to others, and thence muſt needs ariſe a difference in actings.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Heathens are bound to hear Miniſters preach, not onely for their doctrine, nor for their Office ſake, but for Chriſts ſake who ſends them with that doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine: if they preach only as gifted perſons (not as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers) yet it may aptly be ſaid as <hi>Luke 10. 16. He that heareth you, heareth me,</hi> &amp;c. becauſe they are warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or commanded by <hi>Chriſt</hi> to do the meſſage, and ſo it is not their own but <hi>Christs;</hi> he ſpeaketh by them, they are his words, not theirs, as in this inſtance: A maſter of a family being from home may ſend a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage by ſome friends or neighbours to his ſervants, commanding ſome work from them, if theſe ſervants do not hear thoſe meſſengers, they do not hear their maſter, yet theſe friends or neighbours are no Officers, nor can act as officers over them, either in doing the meſſage, or in caſe of diſobedience by inflicting any puniſhment, &amp;c. So if a preachers meſſage be not heard, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is diſobeyed therein; concerning maintenance we have ſpoken in anſwer to Dr. <hi>Collings,</hi> and alſo elſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in way of reply to Mr. <hi>Pool,</hi> The pronouncing of pardon and denouncing of wrath upon believing or diſobeying in preaching, are acts (as we have ſufficiently proved) that gifted men may do, without an office-relation.</p>
               <p>

If converſion of heathens, &amp;c. be the principal ground and end why the office of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry was inſtituted, and the principal worke of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, then the Office of the miniſtry is related to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</p>
               <p>But the convertion of heathens, &amp;c. is the principal end why the office of the miniſtry was inſtituted, and the principal work of the miniſtry ſo inſtituted, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the office of the miniſtry is related to heathens, their relation muſt be towards thoſe among whom their great work lyes, Mr. <hi>Pool pag.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. We ſuppoſe he intendeth that they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to heathens as their correlate, elſe he ſpeaketh nothing to the queſtion; and then,</p>
               <p>2. His <hi>Major</hi> may fairely be denyed; The fighting with enemies, &amp;c. is the principal ground and end why the office of Colonels, Captaines, and other lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Armies were appointed, and their principal work; yet thoſe enemies to be fought with, are not the correlate to the office of Colonels, Captaines, &amp;c. It is a Regiment that is the correlate to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Colonel, and a Troop or company, that is the correlate to the office of a captain: And ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens to be preached to are not the correlate to the office of the Miniſtery, but particular Churches. The inſtance of Colonels, &amp;c. ſheweth that a mans great work may lye among thoſe that their relation is not toward.</p>
               <p>3. As to the <hi>minor,</hi> that convertion of heathens, and ſuch as are without the Church, is a great worke of officers <hi>qua</hi> gifted may be granted; but that it is their principal work <hi>qua</hi> officers, thoſe texts <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. prove not. The office of Paſtors was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted until Churches were conſtituted, had converti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heathens been their principal work, the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them before, would have been as neceſſary as then.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:116041:67"/>
And that officers and others <hi>qua</hi> gifted, are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Chriſt</hi> to preach unto unbelievers, this ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſteth <hi>Christs</hi> care for that great work, the convertion of ſinners, though they do not act as offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in their converſion.</p>
               <p>Thus we have anſwered his argument againſt this Aſſertion, that Miniſters are officers onely to their own congregations, the provincial aſſemblie uſed divers arguments, which we anſwered, and Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> ſeeketh to indicate, we ſhall briefly reply to his moſt material xceptions.</p>
               <p>They objected that we receive members of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther congregations to the Sacrament, yet the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of that is a miniſterial act, and cannot be done but by a Paſtor or Teacher.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Pool.</hi> is ſo diſturbed at our anſwer to this, that he ſaith <hi>(p.</hi> 20.) he queſtions not but any judicious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will quickly diſcern it how we are faln from our own principles, and <hi>(pag.</hi> 21.) would have all men take notice of that, and alſo that we have through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogitancy precipitated our ſelves into the gulf of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſme, and he doubts not but we will retract it, &amp;c. And all this becauſe we ſay, If they perform theſe acts to any, not of their own congregations, they do not act as Paſt ors, as officers to them therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> We ſee no ground to retract what we have ſaid in this matter, and we think any unprejudiced Reader who ſhall view our whole anſwer to their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, <hi>(Preach Sent. pag.</hi> 278, 279, 280.) will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that there is more ſtrength in Mr. <hi>Pools</hi> flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh of words to dazel the Eyes of the weake, then of argument to convince the judicious that we are in an Error. To clear the caſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. We profeſſe that it was (when we wrote our former book) and ſtill is our judgement, that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Sacrament is an act which cannot
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:116041:67"/>
be done but by a Paſtor or Teacher. None but an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer may perform this act.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet we conceive an Officer may adminiſter the Sacrament (which is a common Church priviledge) unto members of other Churches without being an Officer over them: for, if any ſuch relation as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Paſtor and the members of his flock, did ariſe upon that act, then an obligation unto the mutual duties of the relation muſt follow alſo, elſe all in a relation were not bound to the duties of it; and who will ſay that Paſtors are to watch over the members of other Churches, or that the Lord hath made them overſeers of them? or that ſuch members are to aford maintenance, &amp;c. to ſuch Paſtors?</p>
               <p>And if they be no Officers over them, they cannot be ſaid to act as their Officers.</p>
               <p>And let Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> and the Reader obſerve we never ſaid that he who is no Paſtor, no Officer might act in the adminiſtration of the Sacrament, but that in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring it to members of other Churches, a man doth not act as a Paſtor, as an Officer [to them] <hi>i. e.</hi> in a ſpecial ſence.</p>
               <p>As Officers in corporations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may afford ſome priviledges to ſuch as they are no Officers to, which none but ſuch Officers can grant out; Or to uſe the inſtance Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> mentioneth <hi>(pag.</hi> 16.) with ſome variation; many acts of a Steward of an houſe, in giving entertainment unto ſtrangers, cannot he done by any but the Steward (except the Lord of the houſe) yet ſaith Mr. <hi>Poole (pag.</hi> 16.) he acts not as a Steward to them whom he entertains: whence it is undeniable that there are ſome acts which none but an Officer can perform, wherein he doth not act as an Officer to ſome objects of them; and therefore though none but Officers can adminiſter the Lords Supper, yet they may give it to members of other Churches, which
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:116041:68"/>
they are no Officers, nor do not act as Officers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. That Rule <hi>Quod competit rei qua tali competit omni tali,</hi> holds true, onely <hi>in materia neceſſaria,</hi> not <hi>in materia contingenti;</hi> and therefore if a Paſtor gives the Sacrament to thoſe who are not of his own Church, not as their Paſtor, yet it will not follow, that every gifted brother may adminiſter it, or that our aſſertion cuts the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That their Argument was againſt our practice may eaſily be ſeen in their Book, not againſt the aſſertion, but as ſuppoſed (though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groundedly) to be contradicted by our practice. And this is enough to anſwer what he ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 20. 21. 22. and may clearly vindicate us from his aſperſion for Anabaptiſm. He replyeth nothing to what we have ſaid, <hi>Preacher Sent, pag.</hi> 281. where we have clearly anſwered their third particular in the ſeveral branches, and have proved againſt them, that Miniſters are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Elders of the people, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>There are ſeven conſequences which they ſaid <hi>(Jus Divin. Min. pag.</hi> 140.) would follow this aſſertion. To our exceptions againſt the firſt and ſecond of theſe, Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> anſwereth little or nothing; what he ſaith <hi>(p.</hi> 23.) is but a repetition of what he had ſaid before, which we have already anſwered.</p>
               <p>In our reply to the third, we argue againſt that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that a man is made a member of a Church by Baptiſm. Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> telleth us it is none of their aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—-that they allow Infants to be born Church-members, and make their Church-memberſhip the ground of their Baptiſm, and a <hi>pari,</hi> a heathen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and profeſſing the faith, is a church-member <hi>inchoate</hi> before Baptiſm, and that this onely they ſay, that the ſolemn, publike and viſible way of admiſſion of members into the Church is by Baptiſm, Mr. <hi>Poole, pag.</hi> 23. 24.</p>

                  <hi>quidem</hi> of any other door of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and cals the contrary a monſtrous paradox, <hi>pag.</hi> 28. And how he can deny it to be their aſſertion, or free himſelf from ſelf-contradiction in theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions we know not; for what difference is there between being [made] a church-member by Baptiſm, and being [admitted] into the Church by Baptiſm? and how can one be a church-member [before] Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and yet be admitted into the Church [by] Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, eſpecially if there be not [any other door] of admiſſion? How can thoſe that are within the Church already, be ſaid (without a loſs of memberſhip) to be admitted into it, by any after act? ſurely admiſſion is of thoſe who are without, and no members, not of thoſe who are within, and are church-members. The ſcriptures know no ſuch thing as a being church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers <hi>inchoate;</hi> either they are church-members or not; if they be church-members (as he confeſſeth they are, before Baptiſm) then they are admitted, for member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip preſuppoſeth admiſſion.</p>
               <p>2. As well may we ſay, that men are Officers by a Churches Election before Ordination, and onely the ſolemn admiſſion into the Office (or rather exerciſe of it) to be by Ordination, as he may aſſert an admiſſion by Baptiſm after memberſhip; and then the Eſſence of the call to Office, is not in Ordination.</p>
               <p>3. If Infants church-memberſhip be (as he ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 24.) the ground of their Baptiſm, then they are viſible church-members before their being Baptized, (for the ground of an action muſt be viſible, before acting) and ſo their viſible admiſſion into the Church is not by Baptiſm, but before it. And in converts, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of faith (which he ſuppoſeth them church-members
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:116041:69"/>
by) muſt firſt be viſible, and ſo their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible admiſſion into the Church is antecedaneous to, and is not by their Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>And as publike as their profeſſion is, ſo publike is their viſible church-memberſhip, or admiſſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, before Baptiſm. As to what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, <hi>pag.</hi> 24. 25. we formerly did, and ſtill do deny, that a Miniſter ejecting a man juſtly out of his own Church, ejects him juridically out of all other Churches; for this ſee our anſwer to Dr. <hi>Collings</hi> Epiſtle.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>If he be not juridically ejected out of other Churches, then he is in a capacity of being received into other Churches, which what horrid confuſion it would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce, &amp;c. Mr.</hi> Poole, pag. 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw</hi> It will not follow; for, that ſin which made the ejection juſt, would make another Churches ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion unjuſt.</p>
               <p>Yet mens incapacity to be received by other Churches, doth not ariſe from their being caſt out of thoſe Churches, but from the want of ſuch qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as are perquiſite to admiſſion into church-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip.</p>
               <p>He grants <hi>(p.</hi> 25.) that when a Miniſter is juridically ejected out of Office in a particular Church by depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, he ceaſeth to be an Officer to the Univerſal Church. Whence we infer, that if he repenteth and becometh an Officer again, he muſt have a new Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or elſe he may of no Officer become an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer without Ordination, and ſo Ordination is not Eſſential to Office.</p>
               <p>That which followeth <hi>(pag.</hi> 25.) is but a repetition of what he had ſaid, and is anſwered before. That ſuch as are converted from heatheniſme may joyn as members to ſome Church and ſo be baptized, we proved, <hi>Preacher Sent. pag.</hi> 289. he replyeth nothing to the proof of it, yet chargeth us for obtruding uncouth
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:116041:69"/>
notions upon the world without evident proof, &amp;c. And he that ſaith <hi>(pag.</hi> 24.) they are church-members <hi>inchoate</hi> before Baptiſm, and who maketh ſo little a matter of admiſſion into a particular Church, ſhould not ſtumble at this notion. And what is ſaid to ſhew that admiſſion is not by Baptiſm, will not be far from a proof of it.</p>
               <p>Our Arguments <hi>(Preacher Sent. pag.</hi> 292.) plainly ſhew, that their aſſertion runs them upon Anabaptiſm; Mr. <hi>Poole, (pag.</hi> 26. 27.) giveth a double reaſon againſt it. 1. That an excommunicate perſon ordinarily is a church-member, though a diſeaſed member, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. &amp;c. 2. Though his Baptiſm ceaſeth at preſent actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and really as to all the actual priviledges of it, ſo ceaſeth that while he repents not, he is to be looked upon after a ſort as an unbaptized perſon, yet when he doth repent, and readmit himſelf to the Church, he needs no new Baptiſme, foraſmuch as God is pleaſed to impute to him his former Baptiſm, and the Church accepts of it, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Anabaptiſm unavoidably followeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their aſſertion, thus, he that ceaſeth to be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the viſible Church, his Baptiſme ceaſeth ſay they, <hi>Jus Divin Min. pag.</hi> 146.</p>
               <p>But he that is excommunicate ceaſeth (ſay they) to be a member of the viſible Church, for they tell us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication ejecteth out of that Church, <hi>Jus Divin. Min. pag. 139. Ergo,</hi> He that is excommunicate, his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm ceaſeth. <hi>Ergo,</hi> If he be readmitted he muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized, or elſe be in the Church unbaptized.</p>
               <p>Surely Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> will not ſay that one may be ejected out of, and yet remain a member of the Church; for, it is a contradiction to ſay, that one is [out of] and yet [in] the Church at the ſame time, and contrary to, 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 5. 12. which proveth that thoſe who are [without] are not [within,] yet he hath no other way
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:116041:70"/>
to ſave the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters from the dint of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going concluſions. To help them out of this Laborinth Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> telleth us, that an excommunicate perſon is a church-member ſtill; but this is not to defend, but to contradict them whoſe cauſe he undertaketh to to plead; for they tell us an excommunicate perſon is ejected out of the Church, and Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> ſaith, he is a member of the Church ſtill. This therefore might ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the defence of what we have ſaid, but we ſhall add a few words.</p>
               <p>2. It is the judgement of many, that the withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mentioned, 2 <hi>Theſ. 3. ver.</hi> 6. 14. vaſtly differeth from excommunication; becauſe after the one, a man is to be deemed as a brother, and after the other, he is to be accounted as a heathen and a Publican, <hi>Mat. 18. ver.</hi> 17. and if ſo, this is no proof that excommunicate perſons are church-members, ſeeing the Text ſpeaketh nothing of excommunication, but onely of withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>3. We obſerve his halting here, he doth not ſay an excommunicate perſon [alwayes] but [ordinarily] is a member; as if excommunication did ſometimes make a man ceaſe to be a church-member, but ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily not, which there is no ſyllable in Scripture for, and much againſt it, <hi>Mat. 18 v.</hi> 17. excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate perſons are to be deemed as heathens and Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Not as church-members. That ſuch as are excommunicate for blaſphemy, denying Chriſt to be the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> or renouncing ſome ſuch grand Article of faith, ſhould ſtill be a church-member, is ſtrange doctrine, yet this muſt be, or elſe his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>(pag.</hi> 26. is nought, for it may be ſaid,</p>
               <p>He who is under a Church Ordinance appointed, for his good, is (according to Mr. <hi>Poole)</hi> a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member.</p>
               <p>But he who is excommunicate for blaſphemy, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:116041:70"/>
Chriſt, &amp;c. is under a Church-Ordinance for his good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> According to Mr. <hi>Pool,</hi> he who is excomuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate for blaſphemy, denying Chriſt, &amp;c. is a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member. And that the ſame ordinance of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication doth paſſe upon ſome and cut them off from Church-memberſhip, and paſſe upon others and leave them members ſtill, let him prove.</p>
               <p>4. Neither they in their <hi>Jus Divin. Min.</hi> nor we in our former book, do ſpeak of the ceaſing of baptiſm as to the actual priveledges of it, or as to mens ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, onely or chiefly, but about the ceaſing of the water baptiſm it ſelfe; And therefore what Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ith, <hi>(p.</hi> 27.) is altogether beſides the queſtion. Neither doth his inſtance of circumciſion help him, for if any turned heathen or Idolater, and renounced his cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, yet he remained a circumciſed perſon, and his circumciſion might be a witneſſe againſt him though he were to be reputed as a heathen, while ſuch. And ſo we apprehend, though a baptized perſon cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth by excommunication to be a member of any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, yet this baptiſm ceaſeth not, but if it did really ceaſe (as they ſay it doth) rebaptizing would neceſſarily be inferred.</p>
               <p>5. If baptiſme it ſelfe (about which the queſtion is) did ceaſe upon the ceſſation of memberſhip in the viſible Church, that upon the perſons Repentance, the Lord ſhould impute his former baptiſm to him, is ſuch a notion, as (to uſe his own phraſe) in Scripture, there is <hi>ne <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>6. If a man, ceaſing to be a member of a particular Church, ſhould make his baptiſm ceaſe, upon its being the door of admiſſion into that, as they aſſert; then <hi>a pari,</hi> a mans ceaſing to be a member of the catholick Church by excomunication or otherwiſe, would make his baptiſm ceaſesupon its being the door of admiſſion

               <p>He asketh <hi>(pag.</hi> 28.) what is a Church but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men profeſſing the name of <hi>Chriſt?</hi>

               <p>2. A company of unbaptized perſons may profeſs the name of <hi>Chriſt; Ergo,</hi> According to Mr. <hi>Pool,</hi> they are a Church, and then baptiſm cannot be the door of admiſſion into the Church.

               <p>Mr. <hi>Pool (pag.</hi> 28) calleth this a monſtrous para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, which ſhould not have been dictated without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny proof, &amp;c.</p>

Church-memberſhip is a relation, and as it were groſſely improper to ſay that a man is a Father or Maſter, &amp;c. <hi>inchoate,</hi> but not a compleat Father or Maſter; ſo, its improper to ſay that one is <hi>enchoate</hi> only a Church-member, and therefore they are admitted not by, but before baptiſm.

               <p>2.

               <p>3. There are different gifts and graces in the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the myſtical body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and therefore theſe cannot prove it an Organical political body; yet what doth the Apoſtle ſay more of this one body? But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the body be, the relation thereto is not proved to be by baptiſm; as Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> obſerveth on <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27. where we are ſaid to put on <hi>Chriſt</hi> by baptiſm, it is the uſual phraſe of the Scripture, which giveth that unto the Sarcrament, which is due unto the thing whereof it is a Sacrament: So here,</p>

They were ſaved ones, i. e. viſible at leaſt, who were added to the Church, therefore they ſtood in a viſible relation to <hi>Chriſt</hi> in order before addition to the Church, for this, ſee more in our Epiſtle to our former book.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His <hi>minor</hi> is untrue; for multitudes (even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us) are baptized, and yet do not viſibly ſtand in relation to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but to Satan; <hi>Ergo,</hi> Baptiſm doth not make viſibly to ſtand in relation to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Again, a man muſt ſtand in a viſible relation to <hi>Chriſt</hi> before baptiſm, <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 19. They muſt firſt be diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and then baptized; And therefore it is not baptiſm (but ſome thing antecedaneous to it) that maketh vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly to ſtand in relation to <hi>Christ.</hi>

As to <hi>Rom. 6. 3. and Gal.</hi> 3. 27. They may ſhew that believers being baptized in the name of <hi>Chriſt</hi> are ſolemnly engaged to profeſſe and conform themſelves unto him, and that in his death, but they do not prove, that men cannot viſibly put on <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his death, or that they cannot viſibly be in Chriſt, without baptiſm; and therefore they do not evidence, that baptizing is that act in or by which they are ſo much as viſibly made to ſtand in relation to <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our anſwers to this objection, do alſo anſwer his next argument. We ſay, men muſt viſibly ſtand in a covenant relation, before admiſſion into the Church; or unto baptiſm, for viſible believing or a profeſſion of Faith is pre-required, (in thoſe that are adulti) unto baptiſm, <hi>Mark. 16. 16. Acts 8. v.</hi> 12. 36, 37. And therefore baptiſm neither maketh a man to ſtand viſibly in relation to the covenant or to the Church.</p>
               <p>Its being aſeal of the covenant, implyeth a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent conſederation, or preſuppoſeth a mans being in covenant, as being but a ratification, or confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of a covenant already made.</p>
               <p>We demand whether the Lords Supper, be not as wel a ſeal of the covenant as Baptiſm? And whether that maketh a man ſtand in relation to the covenant, and he be in covenant as often as he partaketh thereof, and out when he doth it not? If otherwiſe, then it is no contradiction, that the application of ſuch a ſeal ſhould not make to ſtand in relation to the covenant, and ſurely they muſt ſtand in a viſible relation to the covenant before a partaking of the Supper; and then ſomething elſe muſt make to ſtand in relation to the covenant.</p>
               <p>To his laſt Argument <hi>(pag.</hi> 29.) we reply, It is not that which gives the capacity, but that which giveth the right to Church-priveledges, that makes a man ſtand in relation to a Church. Nei her doth Baptiſm
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:116041:73"/>
make a man capable of Church-priviledges; no not of the Supper, which he mentions; for ſome infants are Baptized and excommunicate perſons alſo, and yet are uncapable of that Church-priviledge; nay the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians will not admit to the Supper without exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and the Provincial Aſſembly plead againſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the ignorant or ſcandalous to the Supper, <hi>Vind. Presb. Govern. pag.</hi> 56. &amp;c. By which it appeareth, that though they donot account unbaptized perſons capable of the Supper, yet they do not judge Baptiſme enough to capacitate for the Supper, for then they muſt deny it to none that are baptized. His Arguments thus fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his concluſions from them come to nothing.</p>
               <p>We denyed that 1 <hi>Corin. 12. 28. or Eph.</hi> 4. did prove a Miniſters relation (as an Officer) to a Catholick vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, if ſuch a Church were intended there; for it may properly be ſaid, there are ſet in the Commonwealth, Juſtices, Conſtables, &amp;c. yet they are limited in their Office to a particular County or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And it is not improper to ſay, God hath given to or ſet in the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> this and that Church, Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Object. 3. <hi>That implies, that its one political body, wherein they are ſet, &amp;c. Mr.</hi> Poole. pag. 30.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If there were a Catholike Church, and that (which is not granted) a political body to, (as a Commonwealth is) yet its being ſaid, God hath given to, or ſet in the Church, Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, &amp;c. would no more prove that they are Officers to that whole political Univerſal Church, ſo much as in <hi>actu primo;</hi> then its being ſaid there are ſet in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth Juſtices, Conſtables, &amp;c. would prove that they are Juſtices, or Conſtables to the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</p>
               <p>Much leſs can it be a proof of any ſuch thing,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:116041:73"/>
where evidence is wanting for a political Univerſal Church.</p>
               <p>Ob. 2. <hi>The caſe wholly differs, for Juſtices, Constables, &amp;c. have limited commiſſions, &amp;c. Mr.</hi> Pool. pag. 30.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> So are Miniſters limited in their office, and confined to their particular Churches (as we have proved) and therefore this maketh no difference in the caſes.</p>
               <p>The caſe of the Empire we ſpake to before, the Princes do not Govern in common, but every one is diſtinct in Lawes and cuſtomes.</p>
               <p>Object. 3. <hi>It is not barely the phraſe we reſt upon, but the ſence, &amp;c. Apostles were ſo ſet in the Church; that they were alſo ſet over the church, ſo are not Juſtices, they are in; not over the Commonwealth, &amp;c. Mr.</hi> Poole, pag. 30.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. is the main Text urged for a Univerſal origanical Church; and yet, Reader, thou may eſt ſee when it cometh to, they are conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to borrow help from other Texts to ſhore up their Argument.</p>
               <p>We grant that the Apoſtles were ſet not onely in, but over all Churches; but that this is the ſence and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the phraſe which the Apoſtle uſeth, or the intendment of this Text, ſo as the Apoſtle ſhould mean, [that God hath ſet over the Church Apoſtles] when he onely ſaith [God hath ſet in the Church Apoſtles, &amp;c.] this is not, nor ever can be proved.</p>
               <p>And its very obſervable that thoſe phraſes might be uſed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11, 12. (the two places chiefly alleadged for a general viſible orginical Church) though thoſe Texts ſhould not be underſtood of the viſible Church at all; for Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, Paſtors and Teachers are ſet in, and given for the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the myſtical body of Chriſt, though they be not Officers to it, or ſet over it.</p>
               <p>And a poor Argument is it, that hath no better
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:116041:74"/>
ground to ſtand upon; this anſwereth what he ſaith <hi>(pag.</hi> 31.) that it is that body into whith we are Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized both <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and one whole body, &amp;c. for all this may be predicated of the myſtical Church or body of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But if the viſible Church or body be intended the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> (and <hi>a pari</hi> all other true churches) is the body of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 27. Now ye are the body of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. and in the very next verſe its added, <hi>And he hath ſet ſome in the Church, firſt Apoſtles,</hi> &amp;c. ſeeing this immediately followeth, it need not ſeem ſtrange that the meaning ſhould be this; The particular Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> is the body of Chriſt, and God hath ſet in this Church or body, firſt Apoſtles, &amp;c. The Apoſtles were ſet in <hi>Corinth,</hi> though not limited or confined to that Church.</p>
               <p>All the ſtrength of their Argument from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. dependeth upon the Apoſtles ſpeaking in the ſingular number [the Church;] had it been ſaid God hath ſet in the [Churches] &amp;c. there could have been no ſhadow of an Argument hence for their being officers to a Univerſal Church; and ſeeing in the ſame chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. 14. 17. &amp;c. he ſpeaketh in the ſingular number, the body, the body, and the whole body, and yet all natural bodies do not make one body, and <hi>ver.</hi> 18. God ſet the members in [the body] &amp;c. yet there is no Catholick body; how can his ſpeaking in the ſingular number [the Church] <hi>ver.</hi> 28. and that in the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the ſame ſimilitude, prove a Catholick Church made up of all Churches?</p>
               <p>To evidence that the ſin of a people may nullifie the Office of a Miniſter (which they deny, <hi>Jus Div. Min. pag.</hi> 146) we ask, whether if they murther him, will not this nullifie his Office? and if ſo, why may not their ſin other wayes make voyd the Office alſo?</p>

Object. <hi>Mr.</hi> Poole <hi>ſaith; we confound the nullifying of the Office, and the hindring the exerciſe of it. 2. He demands whether this hold of the Apoſtles or no,—whether if the Catholike Church was confined to one congregation, and that proved heretical and voted down the Apostles, would this make their Office null or no? he ſaith this followeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our principles, for the church (the correlate) ceaſing, they muſt needs ceaſe alſo,</hi> &amp; ejuſdem eſt inſtituere &amp; deſtituere, <hi>and we allow the inſtitution and conſtitution of the Apostles to the people, in the ſame page he telleth the world that we ſay the Apostles were conſtituted Officers by the church, alleadging,</hi> Acts 1 <hi>He addeth that this doctrine renders it in the power of mens luſts and humours to nullifie the promiſes of Chriſt, &amp; the authority, end and uſe of Chriſts Ambaſſadours; for now there are none but ordinary Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and he ſuppoſeth but twenty congregations in the world, and each of theſe may reſolve ſeverally to eject their Miniſters, &amp;c. This is the ſum of what he expreſſeth in many words, Mr.</hi> Poole, pag. 32. 33.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. We have not confounded, but clearly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed between nullifying the Office, and hindring the exerciſe of it, as he that ſhall impartially read our Book may ſee.</p>
               <p>2. The Apoſtles were extraordinary Officers, our queſtion is onely about ordinary Officers. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were neither of man nor by man, but were made by an extraordinary call of Chriſt, and ſo it did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long onely to Chriſt to null their Office, becauſe <hi>ejuſdem eſt inſtituere &amp; deſtituere.</hi> But we cannot but complain that Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> hath here offered abundance of wrong to us, in reporting to the world, that we ſay, Apoſtles were conſtituted Officers by the church; alleadging <hi>Act.</hi> 1. and not contenting himſelf with ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it once, he cometh over with it again, towards the end of <hi>pag.</hi> 32. of his Book.</p>
               <p>Whereas we have expreſſed the contrary, and that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:116041:75"/>
in expreſſe Terms, in ſpeaking to, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. which he ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth we alledge for it. Let any one read our book <hi>(Preacher Sent. pag.</hi> 268.) where we uſe theſe words, This was but halfe an Election, and that is the reaſon why it did not conſtitute <hi>Mathias</hi> an Apoſtle, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, becauſe the chooſing of the one (which was by God) was the conſtituted act, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 24. &amp;c. by which any one may ſee that we deny the Apoſtle to be conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by the Church, and aſſert it to be by God; and therefore he hath done us much injury in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
               <p>3. Suppoſe a Church murthereth its Officers; either he muſt ſay that they are officers after they are dead, which is abſurd; or elſe he muſt grant that the ſin of a people may nullifie the office of a miniſter, which the Provincial Aſſembly denyeth.</p>
               <p>4. No ſuppoſition may be allowed which imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a contradiction to any divine promiſe; For God is faithful, and therefore will reſtrain from every act that would render any promiſe void. Some ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be admitted of, but not ſuch as are againſt Promiſes, otherwiſe we may anſwer his with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, himſelfe ſuppoſeth <hi>(p.</hi> 32.) that the Catholike Church may be confined to one congregation, if the Elders (poſſibly but two or three) ſhould excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate that whole Church, they ſhould by this juridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call act (how un juſt ſoever) nullifie the promiſe of the perpetuity of the Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 18. as much as by his ſuppoſition the people ſhould nullifie the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes about officers. In ſuch a caſe two or three El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders cannot be proved to be the univerſal Church, and Officers to it alſo, and if there be not a Church &amp; Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers ſet in it, either the promiſes about officers, or the Church muſt fail, if ſuppoſitions againſt promiſes be allowed; And in what a ſad condition then would the Church be in, for there would be none to appeal
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:116041:75"/>
to; and thus we might turne his words <hi>(pag.</hi> 34 35.) upon himſelfe. Or we might ſuppoſe that perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors (being moſt of the world) might murther that one congregation (which he improperly calleth the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church) being but few: its true, the act would differ, one being an act of horrid violence, the other a juridical act, but both are equally poſſible, and ſo a ſuppoſition may be taken from one as well as from the other, and therefore he can get nothing from ſuch ſuppoſals.</p>
               <p>The monſtrous opinion followeth upon his owne principle; Suppoſe but Twenty Miniſters in the World, who only have power (according to him) to ordain, and they through treachery and frowardneſs ſhould refuſe to put forth their power for a ſucceſſion, they dye and ſo the promiſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is nullified; neither doth his anſwer to the objection <hi>(pag.</hi> 33. 34.) take off this, for here the caſe is not wholly different, here is not an act of horrid violence, and therefore it is as great an inconvenience to aſſert, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath given to Miniſters a juridical power (as they judge that of Ordination to be) by the abuſe of which they might, if they pleaſed, diſanul an Ordinance of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. All that flock or Church over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made a man a Biſhop or Overſeer, he is commanded actually to feed and take heed to, and ſinneth if he doth not.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. His denyal of the <hi>major</hi> is little better then a denyal of the very words of Scripture, for the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. Take heed—to [all] the flock over the which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you Overſeers to feed the Church, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Is it not plain, that actuall feeding is enjoyned, and that not onely [ſome] but [all] a mans flock is thus to be ſed?</p>
               <p>2. This doth not anſwer our argument, but leaveth us under a new ſeeming difficulty.</p>
               <p>3. If his reaſon ſhould be wholly granted, we do not ſee how it juſtifyeth his denyal of our <hi>major,</hi> or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away the force of our argument; and had he not left out the concluſion of his Syllogiſm, he might eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have ſeen it himſelf: For the utmoſt he can conclude from thoſe premiſes, is but this, <hi>Ergo,</hi> every Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Paſtor, who hath the whole Church for his flock was not obliged actually to feed the whole Church, all Nations, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And what is all this to the purpoſe? If every Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Paſtor, or every one who hath the whole
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:116041:76"/>
Church, for his flock was not, will it follow hence that no officer is obliged actually to feed all his flock? May there not be ſome officers who have no ſuch large flock, and may ſtand under ſuch obligations? If every Apoſtle was not, yet may not every ordinary Officer be obliged actually to feed all his flock. What ſhadow ofa conſequence is here? This might be enough in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to that which he ſuppoſeth to be an unanſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reaſon; but that his reaſon taketh not away the force of our Argument, we may evidence theſe waies,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the impoſſibility of every Apoſtles loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to all the Churches, is the reaſon which himſelfe giveth <hi>(pag.</hi> 7, 8.) why they did it not. But our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is drawne from a command to ordinary Officers fixed in a particular Church, all which it was poſſible for them actually to feed, and ſo the caſes run not paralel. And that a univerſal Church ſhould be their flock, the hundred, it may be the thouſand part whereof (by reaſon of their fixedneſſe in a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church) they can never feed, and yet be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to feed [all] their flock, who can Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it? Or doth not ſuch a comand rather deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their particular flock to be [all]over which they are made Overſeers?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe the Apoſtles had immediate directions from God, which gave them a diſpenſation for an actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al feeding every <hi>Church.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. Becauſe if every Apoſtle was not commanded actually to feed [all] that flock, or (all) thoſe Churches that they had liberty by their commiſſions to act as Officers towards; ſeeing every ordinary Officer is commanded to feed (all) the flock, he is an Overſeer to, <hi>Acts.</hi> 20. 28. hence his ſuppoſed unanſwerable reaſon faileth in the main thing it ſhould prove.</p>

               <p>But if it were ſpoken to all the Apoſtles together, <hi>v.</hi> 16. 19, 20. then if every Apoſtle was not obliged actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to feed all <hi>Churches,</hi> or all Nations, yet all the Apoſtles together did actually feed all the <hi>Churches</hi> in that age, and were obliged to do it, and all officers together in after ages are under the like obligation, yet no one ordinary Officer is obliged actually to teach all Nations, but every one is bound to feed [all] the flock over which he is made an overſeer.</p>

                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 4. This brings in Epiſcopacy, to make one man an Officer over many Churches, <hi>Preacher Sent, pag.</hi> 248. 283 187.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>The Epiſcopal way leaves to inferiour Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters nothing but the name and Title of Officers, all power of Jurisdiction being ingroſſed into the Biſhops hands, &amp;c. That government by Biſhops is a government by forreigners, as it were the power of ruling being neither in the hands of the people, nor of any choſen by them, &amp;c. The formality of Epiſcopacy lies in this, in the Superiority of one Paſtor to another, and to many other, and of one church to all the reſt in a Dioceſs, not in the Superiority of a colledge of Pastors, or convention of churches over one Pastor or church, &amp;c. Mr.</hi> Poole, <hi>pag.</hi> 37. 38.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. We know not that we have uſed that Argument, but onely in the Pages even now quoted; and in nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thoſe places do we aſſert a government by a Colledge of Paſtors to be Epiſcopacy; its the Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of [one] that we give that name unto; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt that he ſaith here, as about the low countries not being a Monarchy, &amp;c. is but to make the Reader believe that we ſpeak what we do not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:116041:78"/>
2. As government by Biſhops was (as he ſaith) a government by forreigners, ſo is that by Provincial and National Aſſemblies, who muſt needs act (as he telleth us Biſhops do) without knowing or being known to any one Church which they undertake to govern.</p>
               <p>And as the choice of a Biſhop by a Dioceſs, cannot render that Government lawful; ſo the choice of a Colledge of Paſtors, by a particular Church to Rule over it, cannot warrant that; neither having footing in Scripture.</p>
               <p>3. Epiſcopacy lies not only in the Superiority of one, to many Paſtors; but in the Superiority of one to, and uſurped Power over many Churches: ſad experience, as well as the writings of men, do ſufficiently bear witneſs to this. Dr. <hi>Field</hi> of the Church. <hi>l. 5. c.</hi> 28. ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Biſhops, aſſerteth a Biſhop to have Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence over diverſe ſmaller particular congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

               <p>And alſo the Provincial Aſſembly in anſwer to Epiſcopal pleas ſaith <hi>(Jus Div. Min. part 2. pag.</hi> 82, 83. The believers of one City made but one church in the Apoſtles dayes, and add that the <hi>Aſian</hi> Angels were not <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Biſhops, but congregational Presbyters, ſeated each of them in one Church, not any of them in more then one. So that its undeniable, that for one man to be an Officer to more then one Church, for one to be ſet over many Churches, is Epiſcopacy, and this onely do we call by that name, <hi>Preacher Sent. pag.</hi> 248. 283. and that this followeth upon their principles we have there proved, and therefore it is no frivolous or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate accuſation. We may turn what he ſaith upon himſelf, in this Argument.</p>
               <p>Thoſe, the formality of whoſe Office lies in their
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:116041:79"/>
Superiority to many Paſtors, who engroſſe all Power of Juriſdiction into their own hands, and leave to inferiour Miniſters nothing but the name and title of Officers, and make them officers without Office, and whoſe Government is ſuch, as the Power of Ruling is neither in the hands of the people, nor of any choſen by them, and who generally neither know, nor are known to thoſe whom they undertake to govern, they are no Officers of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Let any ſhew any Scripture proof that Chriſt own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſuch as Presbyters, or any Officers of his, who ſo far encroach upon the Kingly Office of Chriſt as to ſet up an Office, not equall with, but even in its formality, Superiour to, and over thoſe Officers that Chriſt hath inſtituted, yea which degradeth Chriſts Miniſters, and robbeth his people of that Power which he hath left them. But Biſhops and their Government ſaith Mr. <hi>Poole (pag.</hi> 37. 38) is ſuch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Biſhops are no Officers of Chriſt. <hi>Ergo,</hi> either Ordination is valid by ſuch as are no Officers, or elſe their Ordination is null who received it from Biſhops.</p>

                     <hi>Wherein our first and ſecond Arguments for gifted mens Preaching are vindicated from the exceptions which Mr.</hi> Poole <hi>laid againſt them.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>HIs fourth chapter hath little in it worth taking notice of. That we do not plead for all that conceit themſelves gifted; he may ſee in what we ſay about a Rule of Regulation; in our Advertiſement to the Reader.</p>
               <p>He findeth fault with our deſcription of the work of Preaching, yet he hath not replyed any thing to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:116041:79"/>
our proofes of it, which may be ſeen, <hi>Preacher Sent. pag.</hi> 20, 21, 22.</p>
               <p>Its not proved that the end of their meeting, <hi>Act. 17. ver.</hi> 16. 17. 22. was to hear <hi>Paul</hi> Preach to them, but he did it when they were met for other ends, and that it is Preaching, though in private, and but to a ſingle perſon, is undeniably proved, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 42. and <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 35. and therefore neither a congregation Sacred, nor the publikeneſs of the act, doth make it Preaching. The end of the work cannot but be ſacred, whoever be the workers; and if this be all they intend, they ſay juſt nothing.</p>
               <p>We cannot but wonder that Mr. <hi>Poole (pag.</hi> 41. 42.) ſhould uſe theſe words, <q>The end of the actor or ſpeak er is purely &amp; ſolely the ſalvation of their ſouls, and ſo it is truely and may properly be called Preaching.</q> Surely if this be enough to denominate it properly Preaching, then our deſcription of Preaching is good; and we may as well ſay to him, as he doth to us <hi>(p.</hi> 40.) then we are all Preachers, bond and free, Male and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male; for any of theſe or any gifted men that we plead for, may make the ſalvation of ſouls the end of their ſpeaking; ſo that if he will blame us, he must blame himſelf alſo.</p>
               <p>He ſaith, it is publike Preaching that they diſpute againſt; and it is that we diſpute for; and ſo we come to the main queſtion.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Whether ſome men, who are not ordained Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers may Preach? or, whether perſons who have Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gifts and graces, or are apt to teach, may ordinarily exerciſe thoſe gifts in publike Aſſemblies, though they be not ordained Officers?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> We anſwer affirmatively, they may Preach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. From the Antecedaneouſneſs of Election to Ordination.</p>
               <p>The major of our Argument he ſaith is not beyond
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:116041:80"/>
exception; yet he doth not flatly deny it, or reply any thing to our proofes of it, or of the other propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. The minor he ſaith, if true, is for the tryal of gifts, and that they diſpute not about, but whether out of a caſe of neceſſity, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> That our minor is true, we fully proved; and that they may Preach for tryals ſake undeniably evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denceth that the Goſpel owneth a Preaching by gift, as well as by Office, or elſe neither Election nor Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination do conſtitute Officers, for they have neither of theſe.</p>
               <p>And if he will grant that gifted men may Preach, untill they have Election from a Church, which they can accept of, we can grant that then they are to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto Ordination.</p>
               <p>There is not a ſyllable in Scripture for Ordination, before Election, and therefore a man may Preach many years without Ordination, if he wanteth Election all that time; and may plead a caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity as well as he that Preacheth meerly for tryals ſake; for its neceſſary a man ſhould remain un-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, until he can take up Ordination in a Goſpel way and order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 2. OUr ſecond Argument is taken, from Goſpel Commands, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10. 11.</p>
               <p>Obj. 1. <hi>It may look backward and relate to hoſpitality; it may look forward and relate to ſpeaking and Miniſtring, and the words will bear either ſence, but both ſences it (it ſhould be, they) cannot bear, that being an undoubted truth, that</hi> ſenſus unius loci literalis non eſt niſi unicus, <hi>&amp;c. Mr.</hi> Poole, pag. 44.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Let the Reader obſerve that the <hi>Provin. Aſſem.</hi> in their <hi>Jus Divin. Min pag.</hi> 101. tels us expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they do not limit the word gift in the Text (as ſome do) onely to the gift of liberality,—but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:116041:80"/>
it—to all endowments of nature,—yea to all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual gifts, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And it is not fair for Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> to undertake the pleading of their caſe, without owning their conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. He ſhould not put us upon the trouble of proving hoſpitality not to be the gift, when they had granted that it did extend to [all ſpiritual gifts:] and this conceſſion aſſured us that they could not fairly deny that the indefinite expreſſion [a gift] was to be taken Univerſally.</p>
               <p>2. What he ſaith for its relating to ſpeaking and Miniſtering, may ſerve as a full anſwer to what he ſaith for its relating to hoſpitality; in regard he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth it cannot bear both ſences.</p>
               <p>3. That every gifted man is under a command of God to uſe or exerciſe his gift as he hath received, is fully proved, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. If we infer from thence, <hi>Ergo,</hi> every man that hath Preaching gifts, is under a command of God to uſe them; how will this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion be avoyded? indeed, <hi>verſe</hi> 11. doth much ſtrengthen it.</p>
               <p>4. That every man ſhould be commanded to uſe his gift, &amp; immediately ſome gifts ſhould be partiticular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioned, and a direction be given how rightly to uſe thoſe gifts, and yet theſe gifts particularized ſhould not relate to the general exhortation, cannot rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be imagined; yet here is the caſe, there is a general command to uſe gifts, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. and ſome particular gifts are mentioned, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. with a direction how to uſe them, and let Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> ſhew inſtances of a like nature, where the verſes have no dependance on each other. Nay as we have <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>ver.</hi> 10. ſo we have <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. and a miniſtration of gifts being required in both verſes, what impartial Reader can think them without a connexion?</p>
               <p>If the miniſtering, <hi>v.</hi> 11. be of any gifts intended, <hi>v.</hi> 10.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:116041:81"/>
that is it we plead for; if it be the miniſtring of this worlds goods, then it referreth to hoſpitality, and its relation to the for egoing verſes is proved either way; and the ſpeaking as the oracles of God cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to relate unto verſe 10. as well miniſtring. So that our argument is firme, <hi>viz.</hi> That every man who hath graces and gifts is commanded to uſe them, and the gift of ſpeaking or Scripture-interpretation is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular zed; Therefore every man who hath preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gifts and graces ought to preach.</p>
               <p>We ſaid it was (a gift indefinitely) and ſo may extend to all gifts.</p>
               <p>Ob. 2. <hi>As he is called to it and in his own ſpear. And inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite expreſſions are limited</hi> pro ſubjecta materia, <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the matter in hand,</hi> Mr. Pool. <hi>p.</hi> 45.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Concerning the call to preach, and the indefiniteneſſe of the expreſſion, we have ſpoken in anſwer to Dr. <hi>Collings. chap.</hi> 3. and that gifted men do not act out of their ſpear in preaching, we ſhall ſhew more fully, by it ſelfe, once for all.</p>
               <p>2. An indefinite expreſſion we granted <hi>(Preacher Sent. pag.</hi> 59.) may admit of limitations where ſome ſpecial reaſons enforceth i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; but in this Text there is none or in other Scriptures to reſtrain it.</p>
               <p>3. A gift of ſpeaking as the oracles of God is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, <hi>v.</hi> 11. and that is enough to our purpoſe.</p>
               <p>That <hi>v.</hi> 10. cannot be reſtrained to hoſpitality, and doth relate to <hi>v.</hi> 11. we have already proved; and that Miniſters and Deacons are not onely intended in the latter verſe, we have further ſhewn in its place, and this anſwereth what he ſaith, <hi>(p.</hi> 45) to our ſecond reaſon.</p>
               <p>He addeth <hi>(page</hi> 46.) preaching gifts are to beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as far as God doth call him forth to the uſe of them, but no further. We anſwer Gods command to

               <p>There is a difference made by himſelfe, <hi>(pag.</hi> 6.) between power and exerciſe; and he that is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to exerciſe a power (by one that hath authority to command) he cannot be denyed to have the power; now every man that hath a gift of Scripture-interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, is commanded to miniſter his gift, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10, 11. and miniſtration being the exerciſe, it proveth that they have power, or are called of God to preach.</p>
               <p>As to what followeth <hi>(pag.</hi> 46.) he cannot but know that the ordinary ſignification of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is (even as, or as) <hi>Eph. 5. 25. 1 Corin. 13. v.</hi> 12. and it being confeſſed by himſelfe that gifts are to be uſed in a proportionable way to the gift afforded, we wonder he ſhould ſeek to draw it to an other ſenſe, we have proved from 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10. 11. That every man who hath grace and publike gifts, is required to preach, and this is a poſitive warrant for their doing of it; and therefore thoſe who will affirm, that there is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception from that general command, muſt ſhew it, elſe the plea is in the ſame Court ſtill.</p>
               <p>Obj. 3. <hi>Here is not onely a liberty granted, but a duty enjoyned, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They who are by vertue of a divine precept to preach the Goſpel, are to do it neceſsarily, neceſſity is laid upon me, yea wo, &amp;c. to give themſelves wholly to theſe things, &amp;c. But all that have preaching gifts are not under ſuch obligations, Ergo, they are not obliged to preach the Goſpel,</hi> Mr. Pool pag. 47.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We grant it is the duty of gifted men to preach, and this text proveth it.</p>
               <p>2. The ſcripture expreſſions which the <hi>major</hi> of his argument is made up of, refer to ſuch as were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly Officers, 1 <hi>Corin. 9. 16. Acts 6. 2. 1 Tim.</hi> 4. 15. and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. And becauſe a neceſſity is laid
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:116041:82"/>
upon officers, and woe is unto them if they preach not the Goſpel, in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, becauſe offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are to give themſelves wholly to theſe things, and not to leave the word of God to ſerve tables, for any to ſay, <hi>Ergo,</hi> All preachers are under ſuch obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; who ſeeth not the weakeneſſe of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
               <p>If <hi>Paul</hi> or other Church-officers were not free from a neceſſity of preaching, by being where they were not deſired to preach, or if they ought to do it, were there but any that would hear them, as he intimateth, <hi>(pag.</hi> 48, 49.) yet there may be other preachers, not to obliged, they having no flock or Church committed to their charge as officers have who may command their Church to hear, but if a man hath no particular Church, from whom can he command audience?</p>
               <p>3. There are caſes wherein officers may allowably not preach, and yet not ſin, though preaching be their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and in ſuch and (we ſuppoſe) in other caſes alſo gifted men ſin not, in not preaching; as for inſtance, a Paſtor going a long journy, upon lawfull occaſions, may on diverſe Lords dayes ceaſe from preaching, if he be in ſuch places where Churches are ſupplyed with officers of their own, denying their conſent to his exerciſing among them, without whoſe conſent he cannot lawfully preach there, Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing judge, <hi>pag.</hi> 6. Here no ſin ariſeth upon his not preaching, or their not hearing. This manifeſteth that they who are by divine precept to preach, may and muſt preach, all due circumſtances concurring, not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, and therefore his <hi>Major (pag.</hi> 47.) is not univerſally true.</p>
               <p>Nor his <hi>major (pag.</hi> 49.) for preaching is a duty, which ſuch a Paſtor may lawfully do, yet in ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes he is not bound to do it.</p>

The like we may ſay for gifted men; the Prophets, 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 14. were under an obligation by divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to Propheſie, yet not onely upon the peoples re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to heal, but upon divers other accounts are commanded ſilence, as</p>

               <p n="2">2. For giving away to others Propheſying, 1. <hi>Cor. 14. ve.</hi> 29. let the Prophets ſpeak two or three, and let the other judge, ſo <hi>ve,</hi> 30. 31. There being many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in this Church, and but two or three of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing permitted to ſpeak at one time, or in one day of meeting, hence thoſe Prophets, (and ſo gifted men in our dayes) may (without ſin) frequently or common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbear preaching. Propheſying was their duty; yet they were not conſtantly, or in every meeting bound to do it, and ſo, Mr <hi>Pools</hi> argument. <hi>pag.</hi> 47. 49. cannot be true.</p>
               <p>And gifted men not preaching conſtantly, may (in many caſes) be warranted as well upon other accounts, as the giving way to, or not hindring of others exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſame gifts.</p>
               <p>His ſecond and third difficulties <hi>(pa.</hi> 49.) that then women muſt preach, and he that hath a gift to be a general Magiſtrate, &amp;c. may undertake thoſe places, have been ſo fully anſwered, that we wonder he is not aſhamed to mention them any more.</p>
               <p>Ob. 4. <hi>Every one is to exerciſe his gift, but in his own Sphear, publike perſons publikely, private perſons privately, and ſo did</hi> Aquila <hi>and</hi> Priſcilla, <hi>Acts 18. &amp;c.</hi> Mr. Pool pag. 50.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The act of <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla, Acts</hi> 18. doth not in the leaſt prove, that ſuch as have publick gifts go out of their Sphear, if they (without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking office) exerciſe them publickly: Church-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers may give private advertiſements, and yet it doth
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:116041:83"/>
not follow, that they may not act publikely. If Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> by hearing one eminently gifted, ſhould perceive him to be un-inſtructed in the way of the Lord, and ſhould inſtruct him in private, would this be any proof that Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> ſhould act out of his ſphear, if he preached in publick?</p>
               <p>He ſaith <hi>(pag.</hi> 50) it is not in the leaſt intimated that they were not gifted to ſpeak in publick.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Nor is it intimated that they had publick gifts, the excellency of them doth not prove it. The weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this objection we have fully evidenced, <hi>Preach. Sent. pag.</hi> 41, 42, 43.</p>
               <p>2. That Text 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 4. 10, 11. commandeth every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that hath the publick gift of Scripture-interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to exerciſe it, and ſo determineth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> it to belong to their place and calling to preach, and proveth that they act not out of their Sphear in preaching, and that publickly.</p>
               <p>This we cleared in our former book by ſix particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> granteth, that they may do the work of preaching, open and apply Scriptures, exhort, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, but not publickly, <hi>pag.</hi> 51.</p>
               <p>So that the Reader may obſerve, that a gifted man may lawfully preach many Sermons privately, it is his publick preaching onely which <hi>Mr. Pool</hi> oppoſeth; we prove that they m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y preach publickly, firſt becauſe a publick gift cannot be fully improved, if it be not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed publickly; this we proved, <hi>Preacher Sent. pag. 47, 48. Mr. Pool</hi> replyeth not to the proofs of it, but ſaith <hi>(pag.</hi> 51.) let them not inter-lope betwixt two callings, and enquireth whether we will ſay, that the Rule is true in general, if ſo, he would infer, that women gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to teach, and men gifted to Rule, judge, lead an Army, &amp;c. ought publickly to exerciſe ſuch gifts, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Rule is true in this particular caſe,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:116041:83"/>
for, this gift is particularized, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10, 11. and a general command annexed to exerciſe it.</p>
               <p>But we ſay the Rule is true in all other caſes, unleſſe where ſome particular exceptions do limit that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rule, or where a gift cannot be exerciſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out aſſuming an office; women are excepted; ruling and judging gifts cannot authoritatively be exerciſed without aſſuming office; but a preaching gift may, as is clear in the caſe of Probationers; Whether they may inter-lope betwixt two callings, is an other queſtion nothing to the preſent purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe publickneſſe doth not make an act to be an act of Office, nor privateneſſe hinder it from being ſo, it neither maketh it preaching nor au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative preaching, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ob. <hi>Though bare publickneſſe of ſpeaking maketh it not preaching, yet that is a property of authoritative preahing. &amp;c.</hi> 1 Corin. 14. 34. <hi>and</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 11. 12. <hi>conclude beyond contradiction, that to preach pubickly is an act of authority, and inconſiſtent with a ſtate of ſubjection, &amp;c. Mr.</hi> Pool. <hi>pag.</hi> 52, 53.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. His diſallowing gifted mens preaching pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, when yet he granteth <hi>(pag.</hi> 53.) that private men may ſpeak publickly in divers caſes, as at Synods &amp;c. argueth him to be (at he cauſleſly ſaith <hi>pag.</hi> 51,) meerly in the defence of a pre-conceived opinion. For he granteth, publickneſſe doth not make authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive acts in other caſes, and yet in this particular caſe, aſſerteth it to be a property of authoritative preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>But we proved before, that it may be authoritative preaching, though in private; and as well it may be in publick, and yet not be preaching office-wiſe.</p>
               <p>2. Thoſe Texts do not at all prove, (muchleſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond contradiction) that to preach publickly is an act of authority, and inconſiſtent with a ſtate of ſubjection.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:116041:84"/>
As to, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 34. All in a ſtate of ſubjection are not forbidden Preaching by that reaſon, but onely women; no man was in ſuch a ſtate of ſubjection as women, hence the Apoſtle, comparing Sex with Sex, preferreth the man before the women, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. ver.</hi> 3. 9. and by a covering, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. 6. ſignifieth the ſubjection of women, and <hi>ver.</hi> 3. 7. denyeth men to be in ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. Miniſters or Paſtors ſtate of ſubjection to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates doth as much forbid their Preaching publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as womens ſubjection doth forbid gifted mens do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.</p>
               <p>And the Text he alleadeth ſpeaketh not a word of mens, but onely of womens being in a ſtate of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. Womens being under obedience, may be a reaſon againſt their Preaching publikely, and yet Preaching be no authoritative act, in his ſence: the unſutableneſs of it to ſuch a ſtate, may make that a reaſon againſt it, and unſutable it may be, though Preaching be no act of authority. <hi>i. e.</hi> no act of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
               <p>As to 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 11. 12. it neither giveth this as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why they muſt not teach in publike, becauſe they muſt not uſurp authority, nor doth it aſſert Preaching to be an authoritative act; for the words are [but I ſuffer not a woman to teach, nor to uſurp authority over the man;] but more of theſe Texts after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>His grounds thus vaniſhing, what he addeth <hi>(p.</hi> 53.) about conſtant and occaſional Preaching, muſt needs vaniſh with them.</p>
               <p>And as to that he ſaith about Alms, that a private man giveth his Alms publickly, is enough to prove that publickneſs maketh not an act of Office.</p>
               <p>That the publick work of a Schoolmaſter may (as he confeſſeth) be managed by any men gifted for it, this ſpeaketh it to be a fit parallel: and as he ſaith
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:116041:84"/>
                  <hi>(pag.</hi> 53.) that work is not reſtrained either by Divine or humane Law; ſo we ſay, the Preaching of gifted men is not reſtrained, but commanded by a Divine Law.</p>
               <p>We grant that a mans ſelf-deſignation for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry is not enough to juſtifie his doing acts of Office; but it is ſufficient (being duely qualified and approved) unto the exerciſe of Preaching gifts; and this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth what he ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 54.</p>
               <p>For, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12. The Apoſtle denyeth the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> (they being but Babes in Chriſt) and aſſerteth, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſtians of long time and much experience to be Teachers in the ſence be intendeth; ſtileth them <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and there is nothing in the Text to limit or reſtrain it (as Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> doth) to private teaching of their families or heathens; all which argueth a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Teaching to be intended, eſpecially ſeeing all Babes in Chriſt have ability in ſome meaſure pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately to teach their families, yet have not ability for this Teaching.</p>
               <p>The word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (without the addition of any other to it) frequently notifieth publike Teachers, as <hi>Act. 13. 1. 1 Tim.</hi> 2. 7. yet would this be a ſufficient anſwer to thoſe Texts, <hi>a genere ad ſpeciem non valet illutio affirmativa?</hi> Surely the uſual acceptation of the word for one ſpecies of Teachers, will deny it to be <hi>a genere ad ſpeciem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas the Apoſtle ſaith, they ought to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Teachers, Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> would turn the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles word, and would have it onely <gap reason="foreign">

Thirdly, For gifted mens Preaching in publick, we alleadge, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>If this place prove any thing to our brethrens purpoſe, it will prove that it was the duty of every one, gifted or not gifted, to Preach in the publick Aſſembly, &amp;c. Their Aſſembling together is not the modification of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation but the matter of it, they are to exhort one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther even to this, that they would not forſake the Aſsembling,</hi> &amp;c. pag. 56.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Thoſe that were not gifted, could not exhort in publike Aſſemblies, to publike edification; and therefore it cannot be ſuppoſed that they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to do it; but this command being left in general amongſt the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> hence none that were gifted, were exempted from doing of it.</p>
               <p>2. Exhorting one another is a work for publick Aſſemblies, and is commanded from them, by way of oppoſition unto others ſinful forſaking ſuch Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and therefore it was to be done in publick Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies.</p>
               <p>If a Corporation or any other ſociety were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to keep up meetings, and there ſhould be added immediately an excitation to a work uſually performed in ſuch meetings, none would deny that it was to be done there; and for Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> to make this the meaning, exhort one another, that they would not forſake the Aſſembling themſelves together; is ſuch a conceit as as deſerveth not anſwering.</p>
               <p>That which he addeth <hi>(pag.</hi> 57. 58. 59.) about its being underſtood. 1. Of Office. 2. Of Alms, hath very little weight in it.</p>
               <p>Let any indifferent Reader peruſe our former Book, and he may eaſily ſee that it cannot be meant of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
               <p>And we have proved in this. that there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between. <hi>ver.</hi> 10. and <hi>ver.</hi> 11. and therefore it
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:116041:85"/>
cannot be reſtrained to Almes, and ſo all his pains <hi>(pag.</hi> 58. 59.) to prove that grace may ſometimes be taken for temporal effects of grace, is loſt.</p>

Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> waveth our Argument as urged, <hi>Preacher Sent. pag.</hi> 68. 69. 70. from the inſtance of <hi>Apollo,</hi> which alone is enough to prove the warrantableneſs of gifted mens preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that publikely without Ordination. But he is forced to flee for refuge to, and ſeek ſhelter under the wing of a few groundleſs objections.</p>
               <p>Obj. 1. <hi>That</hi> Apollo <hi>had extraordinary gifts, is very probable,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 12. <hi>being ranked with perſons ſo quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> pag. 61.</p>

               <p>2. <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> excelled him in knowledge, <hi>Ergo,</hi> It is improbable that he had extraordinary gifts.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Thoſe Prophets,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. <hi>were to hear and learn of others. The Apoſtles had extraordinary gifts when Chriſt lived, yet were ignorant of his death, &amp;c. Mr.</hi> Pool, pag. 62.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> We deny not that <hi>Apollo</hi> was ſuch an ordinary Prophet as thoſe, 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 14. or that he was to learn of others, but that he was extraordinarily gifted: the Apoſtles were unacquainted with ſome particular truths before the clear Revelation of them; yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they, nor any others who were extraordinarily gifted are ſaid to be ſo defective in knowledge of the way of the Lord, after a clear Revelation of it, and to be our-ſtripped by private perſons, as <hi>Apollo</hi> was.</p>
               <p>3. The people at <hi>Epheſus</hi> where he preached, after his departure, were ignorant of thoſe extraordinary gifts, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 24. and 19. 1. 2.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>He might have them, and yet neither they nor</hi> Apollo <hi>might diſtinctly know them,</hi> pag. 62.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That one may be converted and not know it, we grant, but that one may be extraordinarily gifted, and yet not diſtinctly know what ſuch gifts are, or that neither he, nor thoſe among whom he exerciſeth them, ſhould know he hath them, is a thing, as without proof, ſo without any probability of truth.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Apollo</hi> knew only the Baptiſm of <hi>John, Act. 18. 25. Ergo,</hi> had not thoſe extraordinary gifts which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the Baptiſm of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Object. 2. <hi>Apollo</hi> might have Commiſſion from <hi>John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:116041:86"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is anſwered in our former Book, to which we refer the Reader.</p>
               <p>2. It is denyed that <hi>John</hi> gave Commiſſion to any to Preach; and therefore we had reaſon to deſire proof of it, that we might not have the endleſs work of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering groundleſs conjectures, yet withall, we gave grounds againſt it.</p>
               <p>Obj. 3. <hi>There is a far greater neceſſity of gifted mens preaching where Ministers are not, then in a Church where they are. We do not find</hi> Apollo's <hi>Preaching in a Chriſtian Church, but diſputing in a</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Aſsembly, a liberty which we as readily allowed to gifted men, as to write in defence of the truth, Mr.</hi> Pool <hi>pag.</hi> 63.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It was the warrantableneſs of it, not the neceſſity that we ſpake of: but if neceſſity will warrant gifted mens Preaching where no Miniſters or Churches are, their ordinary preaching muſt be allowed.</p>
               <p>2. Let it be obſerved, that they allow unto gifted men the exerciſe of other gifts in publick Aſſemblies; they will allow them to diſpute publickly in a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Aſſembly; and therefore it ſavoureth of a being wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to an opinion, to deny them liberty in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular caſe, to uſe a preaching gift in publick Aſſemblies. We ask him, whether they will allow women and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gifted men thus to diſpute publickly, if not, this might ſatisfie him (if he were candid) that there is reaſon againſt womens and ungifted mens preaching publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which will not forbid gifted mens doing of it, and ſo might ſilence this trifling objection, which is a diſh we have been ſerved with <hi>uſ<expan>

               </p>
               <p>3. <hi>Apollo</hi> was not onely diſputing, but preaching, and that publikely, <hi>Act. 18. ver.</hi> 25. he ſpake and taught diligently, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. in the Synagogues, ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 28. And this being in a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Synagogue, its a full proof that gifted men may warrantably preach in publick Aſſemblies of unbelievers; as our Argument from the propheſie,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:116041:87"/>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. doth prove that they may preach in a Chriſtian Church.</p>
               <p>Our ſecond inſtance is in the ſcattered Saints, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. who went every where preaching. <hi>ver.</hi> 4. with Divine allowance, <hi>Act. 11. ver.</hi> 19. 20. 21.</p>

Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> waveth their defence in many objections, which we fully anſwered, yet ſaith <hi>(p.</hi> 63.) they might eaſily be vindicated from our excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we might anſwer all his book in as few words.</p>
               <p>Obj. 1. <hi>He ſaith, the true ſtate of the argument is here, becauſe the ſcattered Diſciples in a perſecuted ſtate of the Church, in a time when all Church order was broke, Preached and taught Jeſus Christ to heathens and unbelieving</hi> Jewes <hi>occaſionally, therefore now unordained perſons may preach publikely and ſolemnly to a Chriſtian Church ſetled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, &amp;c. Mr.</hi> Pool. pag 64.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. This objection is anſwered in our reply to Dr. <hi>Collings,</hi> in chap. 74. of our Book, to which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Reader.</p>
               <p>2. Way doth he ſay they taught [occaſionally] if there be not ſome that preach ſeldom; yet ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional preachers he could not find, <hi>pag.</hi> 47.</p>
               <p>3. That its being a time wherein Church order was broken, or their being in a perſecuted ſtate was that which made their preaching warrantable, which otherwiſe would have been unlawful, is a meer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, without the leaſt Scripture evidence: ſurely he will not ſay, that nothing may lawfully be done in a ſetled ſtate of the Church which theſe Chriſtians did in a perſecuted, ſeattered ſtate. Doubtleſs they performed many private duties then, they did not omit prayer, meditation, ſelf-examination, mortification of corruption, &amp;c. yet theſe duties are to be come up unto in the moſt proſperous ſtate of the Church; and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:116041:87"/>
as well may the other, unleſs it can be proved not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that it was in a time of perſecution, but that the perſecution was it that made the Preaching lawful; and if Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> will aſſert this, he muſt contradict the provincial Aſſembly, whoſe caſe he pleadeth; for, they (though groundleſsly and contrary to the very Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical conſtruction of the words, as we ſhewed. <hi>Preach. Sent. p.</hi> 75.) reſtrain the ſcattering unto officers, &amp; ſurely officers might have preached lawfully, though they had not bin perſecuted; ſo that Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> muſt either claſh with them, or elſe grant that their perſecuted ſtate did not warrant their preaching, &amp; then his objecton vaniſheth.</p>
               <p>We as much wonder that he can reſt in his anſwers, as he doth that we can be ſanctisfied in ours.</p>
               <p>We ſay, perſecution laid no neceſſity upon them to preach.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Yes, it laid a neceſſity upon them</hi> i. e. <hi>in order to Gods glory, and the ſalvation of ſouls, which could not be had without preaching,</hi> Rom. 10. <hi>and preaching could not now be had in an ordinary way, Mr.</hi> Pool, pag. 64.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This neceſſity was in thoſe places before the perſecution; preaching had been as neceſſary in order to the glory of God and the ſalvation of ſouls, though the perſecution never had been; neither did that hinder their having preaching in an ordinary way in theſe places, they loſt no preachers by it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was not the perſecution that laid them under a neceſſity of preaching.</p>
               <p>Neceſſity can be no plea in this caſe, for the utmoſt that the perſecution did towards their preaching in theſe places was, to put them upon travelling thither, and this onely gave them opportunity, but did not put any neceſſity upon them of preaching. If travels, where they are without preaching, can make ſuch a neceſſity, gifted men ſhall not need want work.</p>
               <p>2. Preaching might now have been had in an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:116041:88"/>
way, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Apoſtles, and doubtleſs would, rather then poſitive precepts ſhould be broken; ſee more of this in our anſwer to Dr. <hi>Collings,</hi> who uſeth a like objection.</p>
               <p>And by this it may appear, that Mr. <hi>Pools</hi> inſtance of the ſhew-bread <hi>(pag.</hi> 65.) can lend him no help, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe here is no caſe of neceſſity to make the preaching of the ſcattered Saints lawfull, which otherwiſe had been unlawful, as there was for the eating of the ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread, to make that lawful.</p>
               <p>If preaching be an act of natural worſhip, gifted men cannot be denyed liberty to preach. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe things that are required by poſitive pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, then Ordination being (according to Mr. <hi>Pool)</hi> eſſential to the conſtituting of a preacher, we ask, how it can be proved, that there can be any ſuch caſe of neceſſity of a mans preaching, when he cannot have that which is Eſſential thereunto? when two poſitive precepts are ſo coupled together, as one is Eſſential to the other, we ſuppoſe if one that is Eſſential cannot be had, a man is not under a neceſſity to come up to the other.</p>
               <p>If a man could not have what was Eſſential to the inveſting him with the Prieſtly Office, then he was not neceſſitated to do the work of that Office; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his caſe of neceſſity muſt be underſtood with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions and limitations, even when it is about ſuch as are onely <hi>mala quia prohibita.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though the ſhew-bread in a caſe of neceſſity might be eaten out of Gods way, and when Election or ordination cannot be had in every circumſtance in Gods way, they muſt be had as they may; yet when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be had in Gods way in that which is Eſſential, they are not to be taken up at all: and Ordination being but an Adjunct to Office, having dependence upon a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent-Election (as we have proved) hence it cannot
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:116041:88"/>
be had without it. He ſaith <hi>(p. 65.)</hi> if neither Election nor Ordination can be had in Gods way, there is no neceſſity of their Preaching in a Church conſtituted.</p>
               <p>But he doth not tell us when there is ſuch a caſe of neceſſity as will warrant their preaching; or what neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity he ſpeaketh of; It was a natural neceſſity that made the eating of the ſhew-bread, and the violation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. of the ſabbath reſt lawful, and unleſs his inſtances ſpeak of one kind of neceſſity, and his application of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he muſt intend that; and ſuch a natural neceſſity indeed they are not under, to Preach in a Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted; but a moral neceſſity they are under, both of precept and means, in order to Gods glory, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of the ſalvation of ſouls.</p>
               <p>We put them upon it to determine whether theſe that preach in ſuch extraordinary caſes be Officers or no Officers; and we ſhewed what miſerable inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences will attend the determining either way <hi>(Preacher Sent. pag.</hi> 87.) but Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> ſaw it to be his beſt way to wave that queſtion.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>He would make uſe of our Argument againſt us. They who were ſcattered abroad, they preached: but many ungifted perſons were ſcattered abroad; Therefore ſuch preached, Mr.</hi> Pool. pag. 66.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> His Argument carryeth with it a reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth of it, <hi>viz.</hi> their being ungifted; for the work of preaching is ſuch as it cannot be performed (with Divine allowance, as here it was, or to edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) but by perſons gifted. Thoſe that had not ability, could not do it; ſo that his Argument hath enough in it for the confutation of it ſelf.</p>
               <p>But the Argument, as urged by us, hath nothing in the bowels of it that doth deny, but much that doth evidence the truth of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>For, it was the Church that was ſcattered abroad, <hi>Act. 8. ver.</hi> 1. and the ſcattering abroad is the very Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:116041:89"/>
which the holy Ghoſt doth ſet out theſe preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by, <hi>v.</hi> 4. Therefore they [that were ſcattered abroad] went every where preaching the word; which plainly argueth that very many, or the generality of thoſe that were ſcattered, did preach.</p>
               <p>As to what is added <hi>(pag.</hi> 67.) that officers might teach publikely, the reſt privately, the Officers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, the others occaſionally: We anſwer, <hi>ubi lex non distinguit non eſt diſtinguendum;</hi> There is not a ſylliblein the text of any ſuch difference in their preaching, But of all of them in general its ſaid, they went every where preaching the word, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. and they did it conſtantly, <hi>Acts 11. v.</hi> 19, 20, 21.</p>

                  </gap>ither had the phraſe been proper, if onely offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers had preached, If it had been ſaid all Iſrael was ſcattered, and they that were ſcattered did ſuch or ſuch a thing, it would have been groſly improper as well as untrue, to ſay that onely the officers of the congregation did it; and ſo here,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. Our fift argument is taken from Goſpel Rules about propheſying, 1. <hi>Corin.</hi> 14. Our firſt Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſme hath the very queſtion for its concluſion, yet <hi>Mr. Pool</hi> ſaith <hi>(pag.</hi> 68.) it may be granted; let him take it in its true meaning, and according to our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of it in our ſtating the queſtion, and the controverſie will quickly be at an end, if it be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>And let it be obſerved that neither our premiſes nor concluſions ſpeak of what was formerly, but of what is at preſent. Our <hi>minor</hi> (which he excepteh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt) affirmes not onely that there [were] but that there [are] <hi>i. e.</hi> in theſe dayes, ſome Prophets who are not ordained Officers; and therefore his exceptions from the Apoſtles, and the extraordinarineſſe of gifts; are vain; ſeeing himſelfe will not ſay, that there [are] Apoſtles, or perſons extraordinarily gifted in theſe
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:116041:89"/>
daies, and our <hi>minor</hi> ſpeaketh not of what [were] but what [are.]</p>
               <p>So that, it is he that ſtumbleth at the threſhold, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then we. Our argument in the urging of it is full enough; for we prove,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That theſe Prophets were not ordained; Indeed there is not a ſyllable in the Goſpel about the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Prophets, neither doth <hi>Mr. Pool</hi> affirm, that they were ordained, but rather concludeth them to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary officers which needed no ordination; and therefore we ſhall not waſt time in replying to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions againſt what we ſaid about that, eſpecially they having ſo little weight in them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That propheſie is a gift, not an office.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That it is a gift ſtill continuing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pro.</hi> 1. That Propheſie is a gift, not an Office,</p>
               <p>Our firſt argument is, all who have the gift of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie are prophets, and if theſe prophets were ordal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned perſon; he denyeth this, but he medleth not with our proofs of it, <hi>Preacher Sent. p.</hi> 89.</p>
               <p>If they were extraordinary perſons, then he deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the other propoſition, becauſe ſuch a gift makes them extraordinary officers. For anſwer to this we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him unto our reply to <hi>Dr. Collings,</hi> and to our proofs that it is an ordinary gift; and if he wil grant them to be ordinary perſons, either he muſt ſay it is a gift, not an office, and then the queſtion is granted; or that there is another order of ordinary Officers for the work of preaching beſides Paſtors and Teachers.</p>
               <p>Our ſecond argument was, that which ought in duty and might in faith be covered by every man who was a member of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> that was a gift on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not an office, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ob. <hi>He denyeth the major, 1. An Office might be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered as well as a gift,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 1.</p>
               <p>2. Shew where God promiſed to every member

               </p>
               <p>3. If an extraordinary office might not be deſired, either it is becauſe it is an office, and that hinders not, or becauſe extraordinary, and then extraordinary gifts might not be deſired, but they might, 1. <hi>Corin.</hi> 14. 1.</p>
               <p>4. It was impoſſible for all to be officers there in that Church, but not to be officers in other places, &amp;c. <hi>Mr. Pool p.</hi> 71, 72.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> 1. The ſecond and forth particulars are anſwered in our reply to <hi>Dr. Collings,</hi> whether we refer the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>The firſt and third particulars reach not the buſineſs; for the queſtion here is not whether it was an office either ordinary or extraordinary; But whether [every man] who was a member of <hi>Corinth</hi> or other Churches might covet to be officers?</p>
               <p>Every man in a Church may deſire to have gifts, that he may be the more uſefull in the body to fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members, but every man may not deſire office, for that were to deſire to be over it; and if this deſire ſhould be granted, that all ſhould become officers, where would be the body, the Church for them to be over? in thoſe daies if all the members of a Church deſired extraordinary gifts, and had this deſire anſwered, they might all find uſe for thoſe gifts; but there could not be roome for all to be officers.</p>
               <p>And there is not the leaſt intimation in any verſe of the Chapter that the intendment of the Apoſtle in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every man in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> upon coveting to propheſie, was that they might remove their ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and become officrs in other places, but that they might be the more uſeful to one another in that Church 1. <hi>Corin. 14. ver.</hi> 22, 23, 24. 26. &amp;c. He ſaith they were to deſire other extraordinary gifts, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. and if thoſe were onely to render them more ſervicable in that Church, with what ſhadow of reaſon can Propheſie be
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:116041:90"/>
ſingled out, and be concluded to be coveted in order to Office in other Churches? Or doth <hi>Mr. Pool</hi> think in his heart, that this was it the Apoſtle did drive at? And how could all the men in that Church become of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers in other places, without a diſſolution of the Church in this place, which certainly was far from the Apoſtles deſigne.</p>
               <p>As for their being enumerated amongſt officers, and before Evangeliſts, we have anſwered it in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to <hi>Dr. Collings,</hi> and alſo in our former book, <hi>p.</hi> 93.</p>
               <p>In that <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> as Prophets did exhort, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 32. as himſelfe confeſſeth <hi>(pag.</hi> 74.) and yet there were others, whoſe work as Prophets was to foretel future events, <hi>Acts 11. ver.</hi> 27, 28. hence it is not ſo improbable as he would ſeem to make it, that there ſhould be two ſorts of New Teſtament Prophets; eſpecially our reaſons from 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 14. being conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; but that anſwer was added <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> the objection being ſufficiently anſwered before, and ſo was no ſubterfuge; he may ſay if he pleaſe, that one ſort were Prophets by an extraordinary gift of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, the other were Prophets by an ordinary gift of Scripture-interpretation.</p>
               <p>As for the ſelfe-contradiction which <hi>(pag.</hi> 75, 76.) he telleth us we boldly charge them with. Indeed, there being like titles given to both the books, <hi>Jus Divin.</hi> the habitations of the Authors of both being in and about <hi>London,</hi> and the Authors of <hi>Jus Divin. Regim. p.</hi> 123. promiſing a book upon the very ſubject of the other, we were induced to think that they had the ſame Authors, but leaſt they ſhould have different Authors we onely laid it down by way of ſuppoſition, not by way of charge; our words are, and here we cannot but obſerve how the the Lord hath left them to a ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction (If the ſundry Miniſters of <hi>London,</hi> publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:116041:91"/>
the firſt book be of the Province of <hi>London,</hi> which publiſhed the ſecond, &amp;c. <hi>Preacher Sent. page</hi> 97.</p>
               <p>By which any man may ſee, that if the publiſhers of the firſt book be not of the province of <hi>London,</hi> there is no charge for ſelf-contradiction. And though they be not of the Provincial Aſſembly, yet it is very remarkable, that they ſhould contradict one an other about ſuch a weighty matter; For if the Prophets be ordinary perſons (as the Authors of the firſt book affirme) that is ſufficient ſaith <hi>Mr. Pool, pag.</hi> 75. and what he addeth, <hi>(pag.</hi> 76.) is far from proving it no contradiction, <hi>viz.</hi> That theſe Prophets were extraordinary officers in reſpect of their gift, and yet the ordinary paſtors of <hi>Corinth</hi> in regard of their office and relation.</p>
               <p>It is a new contradiction to ſay that the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons at the ſametime ſhould be ordinary, &amp; yet extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Officers; as much as to ſay they are ordinary and yet not ordinary Officers. And office being a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, hence if they be extraordinary officers at all, it muſt be in reſpect of their relation, and therefore what he ſaith is very improper, as if they could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Officers not in reſpect of their relation.</p>
               <p>And becauſe they well knew there might be many extraordinary Officers in a Church, yet that would not prove that there were more congregations then one in it, therefore ſurely they intended to deny them to be extraordinary officers, and their complying with <hi>Mr. Rutherford</hi> ſpeaketh as much; ſee more of this in our anſwer to <hi>Dr. Collings.</hi>

                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. That propheſying is ſtill continuing.</p>
               <p>His reply to our firſt argument about therepeal of it <hi>(pag.</hi> 75.) is alſo anſwered to <hi>Dr. Collings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The propheſying was ordinary as we prove by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe arguments, to which he replyeth <hi>pag.</hi> 77, 78. we anſwer,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:116041:91"/>
If the Rules agree to extraordinary Officers, and the work be ſuch as they performed, yet ſeeing the Chapter is ſpent chiefly in the regulating of prophſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and nothing extraordinary is predicated thereof, who can rationally conclude them to be extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Prophets? Neither do thoſe Rules agree to extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary officers, as ſuch, nor is it their worke as ſuch, and therefore it is nothing to the purpoſe. If he could find a whole Chapter ſpent in the regulating Apoſtles or ſuch extraordinary officers in the exerciſe of their Office, and yet nothing ſhould be mentioned that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth to them as Apoſtles, or as extraordinary offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, this would run Paralel; but no ſuch inſtance is found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. We ſay one great end of extraordinary Propheſying is denyed to this, <hi>viz.</hi> to be a ſigne.</p>
               <p>Ob. 1. <hi>They had an other extraordinary gift,</hi> to wit, <hi>a gift of infallable teaching by immediate revelation. Divers of the Apostles had not this gift of prediction, &amp;c.</hi> Mr. Pool, pag. 77.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is not a word in this Chapter or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where to evidence that theſe Prophets had any ſuch extraordinary gift of infallible teaching by immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Revelation; there is as great a ſilence about this, as the other, That divers of the Apoſtles had not the gift of prediction, proveth that they were not extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Prophets; but how this is againſt us we know not; for they had an extraordinary office upon them, <hi>viz.</hi> their Apoſtle-ſhip, though they were not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</p>
               <p>Ob. 2. <hi>I am prone to conceive that the prediction of future events, was rather a priviledge indulged to ſome new Teſtament prophets, then common to all prophets, &amp;c. pag.</hi> 77.</p>

2. That it was not common to all Prophets, we aſſert thoſe 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. were without it, but that there were many new Teſtament, extraordinary Prophets, without a gift of prediction of future events, let him prove.</p>
               <p>Our Argument is from the denial of this gift to them, <hi>v.</hi> 22. not barely from its not being mentioned.</p>
               <p>Though the gift of prediction was chiefly for the ſake of unbelievers, yet alſo for the ſake of believers, <hi>Acts 11. v.</hi> 27. 28, 29. and this anſwereth his third particular <hi>p.</hi> 78.</p>
               <p>Ob. 3. <hi>It is not ſaid that theſe prophets were given not for a ſigne to them that believe not, but that that act of their Office there ſpoken of was not for a ſigne, Mr.</hi> Pool <hi>pag:</hi> 78.</p>

               <p>2. He ſpeaketh of propheſying, not of one act only of prophets, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. but propheſying ſerveth not, &amp;c: Surely propheſying includeth all acts that are proper to them as prophets, yea foretelling things to come is propheſying (though the Apoſtle denieth that to be here intended, by denying it to be for a ſigne) Therefore his denying propheſying to be for a ſign, is as much as if he had expreſly ſaid, that theſe prophets were given not for a ſign.</p>
               <p>Whereas he ſaith <hi>(pag.</hi> 78.) they had divers other extraordinary gifts, as that of Tongues, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of them &amp;c. We anſwer, That theſe Prophets, 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 14. had ſuch gifts, is not proved; and however theſe did not betid-them as Prophets,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:116041:92"/>
but (if they had them) were a priviledge indulged to them, as they were to many others in thoſe dayes, who were no Officers at all, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 44. 46.</p>
               <p>Our fourth Argument is from its not being allowed to women, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 34. which extraordinary propheſie was, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 36. 38. Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> thinketh that <hi>Anna</hi> did it not in a publick Aſſembly, <hi>pag.</hi> 79.</p>
               <p>We anſwer, Its ſaid expreſſely, <hi>Luke 2. ver.</hi> 37. ſhe was a widow which departed not from the Temple; and <hi>v.</hi> 38.

               <p>As to what he ſaith <hi>(pag.</hi> 80. 81.) it hath very little weight in it, for he granteth, 1. That Doctrine is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and giveth no probable grounds that here it muſt be extraordinary; as for the office being extraordinary, it is confuted already. 2. That there is ordinary Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; and his reaſons to prove extraordinary Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations to be here intended, are very weak.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If this Revelation were not common to all the Prophets, then it will prove an Argument againſt him, if ſuch extraordinary Revelation be intended, for we may argue thus,</p>
               <p>Thoſe to whom extraordinary Revelations were not common, were but ordinary Prophets; for they cannot be extraordinary Prophets, without ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary gifts.</p>
               <p>But ſome of the Prophets, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. were ſuch (ſaith, Mr. <hi>Pool)</hi> to whom extraordinary Revelations were not common, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Some of the Prophets, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. were but ordinary Prophets.</p>
               <p>Surely therefore upon ſecond thoughts Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> will ſay, it was common to all theſe Prophets to have theſe Revelations at one time or another, though at this or that particular time it was peculiar to one or two to have them; and then we anſwer,</p>

                     <hi>Anſwering ſome arguments brought againſt the preaching of men unordained to Office, and eſpecially that from</hi> Rom. 10. 15. <hi>about miſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>WE having vindicated our Arguments for the preaching of men un-ordained to Office, from the exceptions laid againſt them by Mr. <hi>Pool,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fully anſwered their Arguments (in our former book) againſt our aſſertion, we might deſiſt further troubling our ſelves about them; but we ſhall add a few words to ſhew the invalitity of them, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> hath ſaid in their defence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 1. Their firſt and chief Argument is taken from <hi>Rom. 10. ver. 15. How ſhall they Preach except they be ſent? Jus Divin. Min. pag.</hi> 68. 69.</p>
               <p>We deſire it may be obſerved by the Reader, that in our former Book, we have largely and fully anſwered the Argument of the provincial Aſſembly from this Text, and alſo many objections; but in this, as in many other places of his Book, Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> ſaith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or very little in the defence of the Argument as they lay it (though he hath undertaken their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence) but by ſome new notions of his own, ſeeketh to patch up an Argument from the ſame Text, and replyeth to a few (and but to a few) of our reaſons, and ſo leaveth i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>What is ſaid by Mr. <hi>Pool,</hi> if it were <hi>cogent</hi> will not prove what is ſaid by the provincial Aſſembly to be ſo. What reaſon hath induced him to take this courſe, we know not.</p>
               <p>The Provincial Aſſembly would gather from this Text,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:116041:94"/>
That miſſion is Eſſential to the conſtitution of a Preacher.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> ſaith, there is an apparent fallacy in part of our reply.</p>
               <p>Object. 1. <hi>A mans preaching may be unlawful. 1. Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantially. 2. Substantially. If he wanteth miſſion, the very ſubſtantial act of preaching is unlawful,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pool,</hi> pag. 83.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is no fallacy in our words; for, It may properly be ſaid, How can they Preach lawfully with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thoſe that are onely circumſtantial requiſites unto Preaching? and this undeniably proveth (againſt the provincial Aſſembly) that this interrogation cannot evidence miſſion to be Eſſentiall unto the conſtitution of a Preacher; and this was it we inferred from it. Had we made it equally unlawful to Preach without Circumſtantial requiſites unto that work, as without thoſe that are ſubſtantial, what he ſaith might have ſeemed more pertinent; but the queſtion here being, whether the foreſaid concluſion can be groundedly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from that interrogation, <hi>how ſhall they Preach,</hi> &amp;c. we cannot underſtand how his words are the to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, it is rather a begging part of the queſtion, to ſay, that the want of miſſion maketh the very ſubſtantial act of Preaching unlawful.</p>
               <p>Object. 2. <hi>The ſum of what he addeth</hi> (pag. 83. 84:) <hi>lies in this, That ſending is ſometimes taken for the miſſion of a perſon already authorized to any place or people, ſometimes for the authorization of a perſon to a work or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. That a providential doth not exclude, but rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe a miniſterial miſſion. That God ſends by ſome call. That the Apostles did ſend by faſting and prayer and laying on of hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Let it be obſerved that he granteth there is, 1. A providential ſending. 2. A miſſion that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:116041:95"/>
doth not authorize to a work or Office, but is of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons already authorized.</p>
               <p>2. We grant, that a providential miſſion doth not exclude, but rather preſuppoſe that miſſion, which conſiſts in Chriſts commanding or aſſigning Preachers to go with the Goſpel unto ſuch or ſuch perſons; of which we have ſpoken, <hi>Preacher Sent. pag.</hi> 125. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>3. We cannot grant, that miſſion is the authorization of a perſon to a work or office; or that a mans Call to Office is his miſſion: our reaſons for the denyal of this may be ſeen, <hi>Preacher Sent, pag.</hi> 121. 122. where we have proved by diverſe Arguments, that ſending is not a Call to Office, or any act that doth conſtitute a man an Officer or Preacher.</p>
               <p>And therefore it behoveth Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> to prove, that a Call authorizing men to Preach is Gods ſending men to the work of preaching. For the Scripture he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadgeth <hi>(p.</hi> 83. 84.) we apprehend, either they onely ſpeak of a ſending which is after authorization to the work they are ſent to do, and this is miſſion properly, which indeed preſuppoſeth a Call and authorization unto that work a man is ſent about.</p>
               <p>Or elſe they ſpeak of ſending figuratively, as often things Antecedent are expreſſed by thoſe which are ſubſequent, as <hi>Gen. 3. ver. 19 In the ſweat of thy face ſhalt thou eat bread.</hi> Sweat which followeth labour, is put for the labour which goeth before, <hi>Mark 6. ver. 9. put not on two coats. i. e.</hi> do not provide two: putting on, which is an after act, is uſed in ſtead of providing or taking which is aforegoing act, and ſo it is explained, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 10. Thus crowning is put for the conſtituting one a King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>So ſending, which is a ſubſequent act, may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe authorization which is Antecedaneous thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. <hi>Pray the Lord that he would ſend forth labourers into his harveſt;</hi> how ſend them? ſurely they were not bidden
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:116041:95"/>
by Chriſt to pray, only that a Presbytery might ordain, or a Church elect thoſe that were already furniſhed for ſuch a work, but that the Lord would furniſh men with gifts, qualifications and all requiſites unto their labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his harveſt.</p>
               <p>Here many things precedaneous unto authorization to the work yet are expreſſed by the ſending. Gifting is not ſending properly, yet here that is ſet forth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. In this acceptation of the word, the authoriza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, the Apoſtles, <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and all the other which he mentioneth, may be denoted by their ſending, yet their miſſion was not the act that did authorize them unto their works or Offices, but was ſubſequent to their authorization.</p>
               <p>But we know not any reaſon againſt a taking miſſion in the other ſence, in diverſe, if not all the other Texts alleadged by him, <hi>John 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 21. As my Faether hath ſent me, ſo ſend I you. i. e.</hi> As the Father having before au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized me to the Office of a Mediator, and as fruit thereof hath ſent me to do the work of a Mediator, ſo I having already authorized you to be Apoſtles (for they were Apoſtles before this) I now ſend you to do the work of your Apoſtleſhip. So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17. Chriſt having before authorized me, hath ſent me, &amp;c. and ſo for <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> &amp;c. As for <hi>Jer. 23. 21. I have not ſent them:</hi> we grant it is not meant of a bare providential ſending, yet we deny this to be the meaning, I did not authorize them to be Prophets; it onely intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that the Lord did not command them to go with that meſſage, to that people, hence its added <hi>[I have not ſpoken to them;]</hi> and is ſo explained. <hi>Jer. 14. v. 14. I ſent them not;</hi> what is that? [neither have I commanded them.] For, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. Chriſt firſt authorizeth them. <hi>v.</hi> 1. and afterwards ſendeth them forth. <hi>ver.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 1. The appointing of the ſeventy, is plainly diſtinguiſhed from, and ſet before the ſending
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:116041:96"/>
of them; that the Apoſtles uſed faſting and praying and laying on of hands, is granted, but that this was miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we deny.</p>
               <p>4. If miſſion be ſometimes taken for the authoriza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a perſon to a work or office, yet that is no proof that the miſſion mentioned <hi>Rom. 10. v.</hi> 15. is any ſuch authorization.</p>
               <p>The argument of the provincial Aſſembly is not from miſſion in general, but for that ſending ſpoken of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. and ſeeing <hi>Mr. Pool</hi> granteth, there is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential miſſion, and a ſending of perſons already au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized, it concerneth him to prove,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Miſſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15. is an authoriza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a work or office.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That an authorization or call by man, is the miſſion there intended: we do not find that miſſion doth any where in Scripture denote the authorizing or commiſſionating of a perſon to an office, by man, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a Church or Presbytery.</p>
               <p>Theſe two things being unproved, their argument which is built upon this text cometh to nothing.</p>
               <p>Ob. 3. <hi>He ſaith, we obſerve that it is brought in as a juſtification of the calling of the Gentiles, and of the ſending of preachers to them by the Apoſtles; and thence he inferreth, it muſt be underſtood of a moral impoſſibility; for if it be taken of a natural impoſſibility, it is falſe, for though the Apoſtles had not ſent them, they might have gone of their own accord, or ſome other way, Mr.</hi> Pool pag. 85.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We did <hi>(Preacher Sent. pag.</hi> 312.) and ſtill do utterly deny, that the Apoſtles or any other men, did give an authoritative miſſion; and therefore his inferrence, that it muſt be underſtood of a moral impoſſibility, is groundleſſe, it being built upon a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that we ſay, preachers were ſent by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, to the Gentiles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and could not have preached to them without their miſſion; whereas we know not that
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:116041:96"/>
the Apoſtles had any hand in any miſſion, but that which is providential, many might (for ought we know) go of their own accord, or ſome other way, that the Apoſtles did not ſend.</p>
               <p>Ob. 4. <hi>If this be only a providential miſſion, then none are excluded; the devils then may be the preachers here ſpoken of, Mr.</hi> Pool. pag. 86.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> We grant, that none are providentially ſent to preach, but thoſe that are before warranted to be preachers: miſſion doth not make a man a Preacher, but preſuppoſeth him to be one: and therefore Devils and all others that want a Divine allowance to preach, are excluded.</p>
               <p>We uſed arguments to prove that miſſion is not a call to office, or conſtitutive to an Officer.</p>
               <p>Our firſt argument is from the Apoſtles having miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion after a call, and being conſtituted Officers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19.</p>
               <p>Ob. 1. <hi>They were not Apoſtles to the Gentiles before,</hi> Mat. 28. pag. 86.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Then every new and ſolemn work, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth for a new and ſolemn miſſion; and ſo as often as a Miniſter removeth, he muſt have a new ordination, if that be miſſion.</p>
               <p>2. This miſſion did not conſtitute them officers, for they were conſtituted officers before.</p>
               <p>Ob. 2. <hi>Miſſion is taken ſometimes for a bare diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of them to this or that particular place or work, and in this caſe they might have a hundred miſſions,</hi> pag. 87.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We take it then for granted that <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. ſpeaketh of ſuch a miſſion as is a bare diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of a man to this or that place, or work, elſe this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is nothing to the purpoſe.</p>

againſt that aſſertion, <hi>Vind. Revind. pag:</hi> 93, 94. and how we ſhould anſwer <hi>Dr. Collings</hi> and <hi>Mr. Pool</hi> when they are againſt one another, let the Reader judge.</p>
               <p>3. It concerneth <hi>Mr: Pool</hi> to prove that <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15. ſpeaketh of a miſſion that authorizeth to preach, If <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. ſpeaketh onely of a providential miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, why may not the other Text ſpeak of the ſame alſo.</p>
               <p>As to the ſeventy diſciples, his ſaying <hi>(pag.</hi> 87.) that if they had miſſion from Chriſt, that made them Officers, is a begging the queſtion; it is poor arguing, when that which is the queſtion, is made the anſwer to an argument.</p>
               <p>Whether miſſion maketh or conſtituteth men officers, is here the queſtion, yet its brought as a reply to our argument. And ſeeing he granteth a miſſion that doth not authorize, he might eaſily underſtand that there is no contradiction in it, to ſay, they were ſent and yet were not Officers.</p>
               <p>Our fourth argument he altereth both in the words and ſenſe, and then replyeth to it <hi>pag.</hi> 87. but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his words, all that are inſtrumental in an ordinary way to others converſion would be proved and evidenced to be Officers, if miſſion were a call to Office.</p>
               <p>He would have proved <hi>(pag.</hi> 88.) that miſſion is ordination: but he giveth not one Scripture for it.</p>
               <p>He telleth us of mens having a commiſſion to preach two waies, the one extraordinary, the other ordinary, by ſetting them apart to the work, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But what is this to the purpoſe; he knoweth it is not granted, either that the ſetting apart he intendeth, is miſſion, or that ſuch a ſetting apart or miſſion doth authorize and commiſſionate men to preach.</p>
               <p>He telleth us <hi>(pag.</hi> 89.) of clear conſequences for miſſion, being ordination, yet ſheweth not one of them.</p>

               <p>That Goſpel Miniſters are a Superiour or equal or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the high Prieſt, is not proved, they may be preferred before them in reſpect of many new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment privelidges, which neither <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> nor any Old Teſtament officers did injoy; but that the order or Office is ſuperiour to the high Prieſt who ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified Chriſt, (not as <hi>Bulls</hi> and <hi>Goats,</hi> &amp;c, but) as our High-Prieſt, this we ſee no proof for.</p>
               <p>And becauſe Chriſt was called to the Higheſt Office, therefore none may undertake any office with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a call; though we deny not the need of a call, yet we cannot ſee the force of this conſequence.</p>

                     <hi>Anſwering what Mr.</hi> Pool <hi>ſaith in defence of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Aſsemblies eight arguments against doing the work of the Ministry without Ordination.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Provincial aſſembly urged eight Arguments to prove, that none may do the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry without ordination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. Their firſt argument is, that work for the doing of which God hath deſigned ſpecial Officers of his, neither ought nor may be done by any others, &amp;c. We anſwer, prayer, diſtribution of wordly goods, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting and rebuking are ſuch works, yet others may performe them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:116041:98"/>
Ob. 1. <hi>Prayer he denyeth to be a worke for which the Office of the Ministry was deſigned. The Deacons work is the diſtribution of the Churchs Goods, which none but Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons may do. The work of reproving and exhorting they may do, but privately, not publickly, Mr.</hi> Pool. page 96.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That prayer is a work for which the Office of the Miniſtry was deſigned, is ſtrongly intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Acts 6. v.</hi> 4. where <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is appled to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as well as the Miniſtry of the word, and it is a word very ſignificant, it denoteth a mans making it his work and buſineſſe, and that conſtantly, his attending, bending and applying himſelf to it, and being inſtant in it; to which his inſtance about hoſpitality, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1. runneth not paralel.</p>
               <p>In the Biſhops daies, when liberty of praying was almoſt denyed Preachers, then it was accounted their work; and if it be not, private men may pray pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, as well as perform other acts.</p>
               <p>2. Exhorting and Rebuking are the works of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and diſtribution of wordly goods is the work of Deacons, and this is enough to ſhew the invalidity of their argument; for hence a propoſition directly oppoſite to theirs is true, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſome works, for the doing of which, God hath deſigned ſpecial Officers of his owne, ought or may be performed by ſome that are not deſigned unto thoſe Offices; and ſo their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is falſe.</p>
               <p>That they are the Churches goods which Deacons diſtribute, onely ſheweth that none but Deacons can act under that Office relation, and ſo we grant none may preach under the relation of a paſtor, but he that is an officer. Therefore <hi>Mr. Pool</hi> runneth to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of acting, They may exhort and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> buke, but pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, not publickly.</p>
               <p>We tell him if an officer exhorteth or rebuketh in private, it may be an act of office.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:116041:99"/>
Ob. 2 <hi>That no act but a publick act is an act of office, we afirme not; an Officers private rebuke is an act of office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Hence it followeth, that publickneſſe is not an inſeparable property of Office, or is not that which maketh an act to be an act of Office; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men cannot be charged with aſſuming or inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding office barely for their exhorting in publick.</p>
               <p>2. This <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>overturneth their argument for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate exhorting and rebuking (being as he granteth acts of office) are works, for the doing of which God hath deſigned ſpecial officers of his own, yet they may be performed by ſome that are not deſigned unto thoſe Offices.</p>
               <p>Their exhorting and rebuking in private might as well be called a uſurping Office, as their doing it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly.</p>
               <p>To prove their argument they bring the examples of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Vzzah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We tell them,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Either theſe inſtances are impertinent, or none out of Office may preach in caſes of neceſſity.</p>
               <p>Ob: 3. <hi>The caſe is not paralel, nor is the neceſſity alike; Preaching is abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation, ſo is not ſacrificing,</hi> pag. 97.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Preaching is neceſſary, but not abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation; it is one, but not the onely means; for parental and other private inſtructions may be uſeful to that end.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To prove that ſuch as are onely <hi>mala quia prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bita,</hi> may be done in a caſe of neceſſity, himſelfe <hi>(pag.</hi> 65.) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lledgeth <hi>Davids</hi> eating the Shew-bread, yet that did not make ſuch a caſe of neceſſity as there is of preaching unto ſalvation, and ſo our argument is as ſtrong as his.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This is a meer fallacy; for he ſpeaketh of the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:116041:99"/>
work of preaching being more neceſſary then the work of Sacrificing; whereas we ſpeak of the neceſſity that perſons are under to performe thoſe works. And if the neceſſity of preaching unto ſalvation will juſtifie the preaching of men out of office, they can never want a caſe of neceſſity. What he addeth about ſacrifices and Sacraments, is not againſt our objection, but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to intimate that Sacraments are more limited and confined to office then preaching, though they be not ſo neceſſary to Salvation, and ſo proveth their fourth argument to be falſe.</p>
               <p>2. We tell him that theſe acts of <hi>Saul, Vzzah</hi> and <hi>Vzziah</hi> were expreſly forbidden, and ſome of them threatened with death, <hi>Numb.</hi> 4. 15, and 16. 40. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ob. 4. <hi>A thing may be prohibited either in expreſse termes, or by ſolid conſequence;</hi> Vzzah <hi>was puniſhed not principally, at leaſt, not ſolely becauſe he did touch the</hi> Ark <hi>with his hands, but becauſe he did not bear it upon his ſhoulders. He argueth from</hi> 1. Corin. 14. 34. <hi>That an expreſse prohibition is not neceſſary. And addeth that there is no more expreſſe prohibition to reſtrain men from admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string the Sacraments, then from preaching, the reaſon of the prohibition is the ſame in both, to wit, becauſe Officers were appointed for thoſe works, Mr.</hi> Pool, pag. 98, 99.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We grant that we are to be ſatisfied with Scripture conſequences, but that the preaching of gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted men out of Office is prohibited by any ſolid conſequence, we find not.</p>
               <p>2. We wonder how <hi>Mr. Pool</hi> durſt ſay, that <hi>Vzzah</hi> was not puniſhed principally, at leaſt not ſolely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did touch the <hi>Ark</hi> with his hands, ſeeing it is ſaid expreſly, 1 <hi>Cron. 13. v. 10. The anger of the Lord was kindled against</hi> Vzzah <hi>and he ſmote him,</hi> [becauſe he put his hand to the <hi>Ark]</hi> and there he died before God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:116041:100"/>
3. For 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 14. 34. we have ſpoken to it before. It cannot prohibit the preaching of all perſons under authority; for all Church-officers are under authority to Magiſtrates; and all young Scholars (whoſe parents are living) are under authority to their parents, yet if they have ſubmitted to Ordination, he will grant they may Preach; and if ſuch a being under authority be intended, as is peculiar to women, then nothing can be concluded thence againſt the preaching of gifted men.</p>
               <p>4. That Gods appointing officers to do a work, doth not prohibit others doing of it, we have already evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced; and therefore Officers being appointed to Preach, doth not by conſequence prohibit others preaching.</p>
               <p>5. An expreſſe prohibition, or Gods appointing Officers to adminiſter the Sacraments, are not the chief, much leſſe the only Arguments againſt their doing it, who are no Officers; there are many other <hi>mediums</hi> that prove the adminiſtration of Sacraments to be more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained unto Officers then Preaching; as from others not having ſuch a Divine allowance for that, as we have proved they have for preaching, from the Sacraments, being purely by inſtitution, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>There is no prohibition either expreſſe or by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, of gifted mens preaching, and though this doth not prove that they may preach, yet it ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evidenceth the weakneſs of their Argument againſt their preaching; for the Acts of <hi>Saul, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zza</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> were expreſly forbidden and threatned; and ſo their Argument hath colour onely, and no ſubſtance. As to <hi>pag.</hi> 100. publick preaching is not the whole work of a Miniſter, any more then private exhorting or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buking; and ſeeing he granteth private rebuking by an Officer to be an act of Office, either private Chriſtians doing this, rendreth Gods Officers void or unneceſſary as to that act of their office, and ſo one appointment of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:116041:100"/>
God ſhould be vain (which it were an impeachment to to the wiſdom of God to aſſert, yet he ſaith little leſs, <hi>pag.</hi> 100) or elſe gifted mens preaching in publick will not render Gods Officers vain or unneceſſary, as to that act of their office, <hi>viz.</hi> publick Preaching.</p>
               <p>Himſelf granteth that men are not reſtrained by humane or Divine Lawes from keeping School, yet a general liberty for that publick work breaketh no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, no more doth a liberty for gifted mens Preaching in publick.</p>
               <p>But our inſtance of a Fathers and a Schoolmaſters, Teaching prove, that diſtinction between relations is not deſtroyed by their doing the ſame works, and this we produced it for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 2. Their ſecond Argument, is from gifted perſons not being appointed or warranted thereunto: for then every gifted man that Preacheth not is guilty of a ſin of omiſſion.</p>
               <p>We anſwer, gifted men are appointed to Preach, yet the want of opportunity or a Call from others, may free it from being a ſin of omiſſion.</p>
               <p>Object. 1. Peter <hi>was forbidden to preach, yet he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it his duty,</hi> Act. 5. 29. <hi>if gifted men were appointed by God to preach, no men (by negligence in not deſiring them) could diſoblige them,</hi> pag. 101.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Officers are called to preach by the Churches they are over, and if thoſe Churches ſhould grow neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and not deſire them, yet they ought to Preach, if they will hear. In ſome caſes Officers are obliged to preach (as <hi>Peter</hi> was, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 29) when men forbid them, yet when circumſtances do not concur, they do not ſin though they forbear.</p>
               <p>2. Gifted men are ſo obliged to preach, that no men can diſoblige them; but as to the exerciſe here or there at this or that time, many things may hinder an obligation to that, as we proved before. To pray,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:116041:101"/>
read, hear, and privately to exhort, &amp;c. are duties that Chriſtians are obliged to by their general calling, yet men may ſin if they act in theſe, ſo as to neglect or juſtle out the works of their ſpecial calling, for it is duty to be exerciſed therein alſo; and therefore mens acting in ſuch duties muſt be determined by the ſpecial calling (as to the time) or by conveniency, opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp;c. and ſo for gifted mens Preaching.</p>
               <p>Object. 2. <hi>If Preaching gifts be talents,</hi> Mat. 25. <hi>then whoever uſeth them not is under a curſe,</hi> pag. 102.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Talents (though not uſed) are not as talents wrapped up, unleſs through ſlothfulneſs or wickedneſs, the uſe be neglected, <hi>Mat. 25. ver.</hi> 26. If one 'hath a talent of Counſel, and counſel be deſpiſed, he that hath the talent is free.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 3. Their third Argument is, no man may do the Office of a Magiſtrate or Deacon who is not called to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> taketh a little piece of our reply, and ſeeketh to anſwer it with his caſe of neceſſity, which we have ſpoken often enough to; our chief anſwers he ſaith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to.</p>
               <p>Whereas he telleth us of ſetting up our own devices in Gods worſhip <hi>(pag.</hi> 103.) we wiſh their way were not more guilty of this evil then ours. And if it be a ſin for ungifted men, or ſuch as are erroneous, to preach, ſurely a Church is to take care that its mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers be not guilty of it, and this will amount to little leſs then a proof, that there may be approbation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Ordination.</p>
               <p>Our inſtance of believing, which he mentioneth <hi>(pag.</hi> 104.) proveth, that one may perform a work of greater conſequence, and yet may not perform a work of leſs conſequence, and ſo was no fallacy; but now he reſtraineth it unto ſuch works as relate to others, we ſhal inſtance in private exhorting, this is a work of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:116041:101"/>
conſequence, difficulty and danger, then the works of Magiſtrates or Deacons, and that for the reaſons they mention <hi>(Jus Divin. Min. pag. 87.) viz.</hi> becauſe if they miſcarry in private exhortation, they deſtroy ſouls, yet private Chriſtians may do that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. Their fourth Argument is, none may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Sacrament who is uncalled, <hi>Ergo,</hi> none may preach who is uncalled; for theſe two are joyned together, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. Our firſt reply to this, Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> again would anſwer with neceſſity, but that in any caſe they may preach, but may not adminiſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it ſpeaketh their Argument invalid. We tell him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. is no commiſſion authorizing them to preach and baptize, and ſo their being joyned together there is no proof, that onely thoſe may preach who may baptize.</p>
               <p>Object. 1: <hi>Mr.</hi> Pool <hi>thinketh that they were not Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, nor had their Commiſſion as Apoſtles till</hi> Mat 28. 19. 20. <hi>this he ſaith is probable by theſe three conſiderations. 1. That an Apoſtle was a new Teſtament Officer, and the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did not begin till the death of Chriſt. 2 They had not Apoſtolical gifts before the death of Chriſt. 3. They wanted <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality of juriſdiction, &amp;c. Mr.</hi> Pool. pag. 105.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. When we urged <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19 20. he taketh it for a miſſion that doth not authorize to a work <hi>(p.</hi> 87.) elſe his anſwer cometh to nothing; and yet here would have it be the Apoſtles Office-making Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; how he is conſiſtent with himſelf herein, we ſee not, one of theſe replies muſt be naught.</p>
               <p>2. Long before the death of Chriſt its ſaid, <hi>Luke 6. ver. 12. 13. He continued all night in prayer to God, and when it was day, be called unto him his Diſciples, and of them he choſe twelve, whom alſo he named</hi> [Apoſtles.] We prove that they were Apoſtles before, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. 20. by theſe conſiderations.</p>

1. Chriſt impoſed the name of Apoſtles upon them, <hi>(Luke</hi> 6. 13.) before <hi>Mat. 28. Ergo,</hi> They had the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Apoſtles upon them before. For ſurely Chriſt would not put the name of an Office upon them, if they had not the Office that anſwered that name. The ſeventy were ſent out to preach, yet had no ſuch title put upon them, but the name of Apoſtles was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly given to the Twelve before the death of Chriſt, <hi>Luke 17. 5. Luke 22. ver. 14. Mat.</hi> 10. 2. and therefore Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> is too bold with Scripture, to put other names upon them (as Prophets or extradinary Teachers) when the Goſpel never knoweth them by theſe names, but by the name of Apoſtles.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt choſe them before, <hi>Mat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 28. &amp; the name of Apoſtles being at the ſame time put upon them, hence they were choſen to be Apoſtles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 13. and this was after ſolemn prayer. <hi>Ergo,</hi> They were Apoſtles before, for Election is the conſtitutive act of their office.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They had Apoſtolical gifts (though not in ſo full meaſure) before the death Chriſt, <hi>Mat. 10. ver. 1. He gave them power againſt unclean ſpirits to caſt them out, and to heal all manner of ſickneſs, and all manner of diſeaſe.</hi> And this anſwereth his ſecond conſideration.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Matthias</hi> was put into the ſame Office that <hi>Judas</hi> was in, before the death of Chriſt, for its ſaid, <hi>Act. 1. ver. 25. He is to take part of this miniſtry and Apoſtleſhip from which Judas by tranſgreſſion fell.</hi> Now <hi>Matthias</hi> undeniably was an Apoſtle, <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſo was <hi>Judas</hi> and the eleven before the death of Chriſt. Yea this Text cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the Office both of <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Mathias</hi> an Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and to be ſure <hi>Judas</hi> was not an Apoſtle after the death of Chriſt, for he did not onely betray his Maſter, but alſo hanged himſelf.</p>
               <p>3. To his firſt conſideration we anſwer, The new Teſtament if taken for the doctrine of the Goſpel as 2 <hi>Corin.</hi> 3. of which they were Miniſters, was begun
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:116041:102"/>
long before the death of Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 78. and 2. <hi>v.</hi> 10. as alſo in other acceptations of it; but ſuppoſe the new Teſtament did not begin till the death of Chriſt, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is a new Teſtament Ordinance, and this he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny ſeeing he maketh it the onely door of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into the new Teſtament or Goſpel Church. <hi>(p.</hi> 25.) and it is eaſie to prove it upon truer and better grounds; Yet baptiſme was adminiſtred by the twelve long before the death of Chriſt, <hi>Job. 4. ver.</hi>

                  </gap>. 2. and to multitudes by <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt: And the firſt conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Apoſtles (new Teſtament Officers) might as well be before the death of Chriſt, as the firſt admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Baptiſme (a new Teſtament Ordinance) might be before it. If after the new Teſtament began, Apoſtles became officers, and Baptiſme an Ordinance thereof, yet as it was the ſame Baptiſm, ſo they were the ſame officers. <hi>viz.</hi> Apoſtles, before and after. And this alſo may anſwer his third conſideration, If thoſe that were Baptized before the death of Chriſt were Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members, then there was a Church which the Apoſtles might have juriſdiction over; if they were not, why might not they be Apoſtles without juriſdiction, as well as perſons be baptized without Church-memberſhip if Baptiſme be (as he would have it) a door of admiſſion into the Church?</p>
               <p>Officers he ſaith they were, and to be Officers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any juriſdiction. (as he ſaith theſe were) is as ſtrange as to be Apoſtles without Univerſality of juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. And if all this were not enough, the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narineſs of their Call or that time, might better be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged in this caſe, then it is in many againſt us.</p>
               <p>Object. 2. <hi>It muſt needs be granted that it is a renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, confirming, and enlarging of their former Commiſſion, and this double work being equally impoſed upon them, muſt by like reaſon be equally restrained to them, unleſs better grounds can be ſhewn to the contrary, &amp;c.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Any impartial Reader may ſee enough in our former book <hi>(Preacher Sent, pag.</hi> 168. 169.) to take off this reply.</p>
               <p>It was an enlargement of the Apoſtles Commiſſion to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> making them capable of being preached to and baptized, but its no proof, that onely thoſe may preach, who may baptize.</p>
               <p>If it ſhould be ſaid to Elders and Deacons, Go teach, Rule and diſtribute to the Church in ſuch a place, would the joyning of theſe together in an exhortation, prove, that every one who may Rule may Teach, or that none may diſtribute, but he that may Teach? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no. Thus, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. 20. Its ſaid to Preachers and Baptizers, Go Preach and baptize all Nations, yet this cannot prove, that none may preach but thoſe who may baptize; it onely ſheweth that ſuch as had power to Preach, might now lawfully Preach to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and ſuch as had power to baptize, might now adminiſter baptiſm to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which before they might not. He impoſeth the works on thoſe that had power for them, doth not reſtrain the power to perform the one unto them that had power to perform the other. The intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Text is not (that it can be proved) to ſhew that all who may Preach may Baptize, but to warrant ſuch as may do thoſe works, in their Preaching to, and Baptizing the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Let it be obſerved what their Argument is come to; it ſhould prove, that none may Preach but thoſe who may adminſter the Sacraments, and at laſt it is, unleſs we can ſhew reaſon to the contrary, the works are equally ſtrained; we have given reaſons enough to the contrary, and ſo the Argument proveth juſt nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 5. Their fifth Argument is, To Preach with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out calling and Ordination to the work is to uſurp
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:116041:103"/>
authority over the Church; to prove which they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert preaching to be an act of authority, <hi>Hebr. 7. 1 Tim.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
               <p>The weakneſſe of this argument we largely ſhewed, <hi>Preacher Sent, pag.</hi> 171, 172, 173. but Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> replyeth not to what we have there ſaid. He telleth us <hi>(pag.</hi> 107.) if a man preacheth to heathens, he cannot uſurp authority over the Church, and this enervateth their argument. We deny that men uſe office-authority to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heathens in preaching to them, they do not act as over them; his very inſtance confuteth this; for an Ambaſſador hath not authority over him that he is ſent to treat with in a large ſenſe, we have proved that gifted men have authority, and that from the Scripture, to preach without ordination; and ſo we do not croſſe the golden ſaying of <hi>Tgnatius,</hi> which he mentioneth, <hi>pag.</hi> 107.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7. we ſaid (amongſt other things) he that bleſſeth, by an original inherent power, as Chriſt doth, he is greater then he that is bleſſed, and of ſuch bleſſing the Text ſpeaketh, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ob. <hi>This is very groſſe; the Text evidently ſpeaks of</hi> Melchiſedeck, <hi>who bleſſed onely miniſterially, and not by an original power, &amp;c.</hi> pag. 108.</p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. We did not ſay that <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> bleſſed by an original power, our words plainly give that power to Chriſt onely.</p>
               <p>2. That the Text hath reference unto Chriſt (who hath an original power to bleſſe) we proved, and it is clear, <hi>Heb. 6. v. 20.—Jeſus made an high Prieſt forever after the order of</hi> Melchiſedeck, and <hi>Heb. 7. v.</hi> 11, 12. 14. 17. After the ſimilitude of <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> there ariſeth another Prieſt, <hi>ve.</hi> 15. Whence it is evident that the Apoſtles main ſcope, drift and deſigne is to ſet forth Chriſt in his greatneſſe and excellency, by comparing him with <hi>Melchiſedeck;</hi> for ſeverall things are ſpoken of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:116041:104"/>
                  <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> that do more properly belong unto Chriſt, then to him; as he is ſaid to be <hi>without Father, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Mother, and withuut beginning, Heb.</hi> 7. 3. yet <hi>Melchiſadeck</hi> was a man, and not God, and ſo as to his natural being, had a Father, a Mother, and a beginning; and therefore theſe things are ſpoken of him, (as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith) as of one cloathed with the perſon of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thus the Apoſtle declareth, not onely how Chriſt concurred in the particular act of bleſſing <hi>Abraham;</hi> but the greatneſſe of <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> who bleſſed <hi>Abraham</hi> is mentioned, chiefly to notifie the greatneſſe of Chriſt, who bleſſed the faithful after that ſimilitude, <hi>viz.</hi> with an extraordinary High-Prieſts bleſſing.</p>
               <p>From all which it is evident, that if <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> bleſſed only miniſterially, yet ſeeing the chief deſigne of the Text is to ſet forth Chriſts acting as a high-Prieſt in bleſſing, hence as it hath reference unto him, ſo a bleſſing by an original power is intended.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> bleſſed by an extraordinary autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and this can be no proof that all ordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who bleſſe others, have a ſuperioriry over thoſe that are bleſſed; and ſo this ſpeaketh nothing to his purpoſe.</p>
               <p>As to 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 12. we told them there is a plain diſtinction and difference in that very Text, between teaching and uſurping authority, as [nor] doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate.</p>
               <p>Ob. 1. <hi>It is a familiar thing to uſe a word diſjoyning one thing from an other, when indeed the one explaines the other,</hi> Rev. 22. 15. Gal. 1. 12. Mr. Pool pag. 108.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If ſometimes a word diſjunctive be expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, yet uſually it is not ſo; multitude of inſtances might be given where things disjoyned by an <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> doth. The things are diſtinct in <hi>Gal. 1. 12. I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it,</hi> &amp;c. i. e. I neither was taught it by others, nor did I learn it of my ſelfe, by my own ſtudy and induſtry; there is a teaching, and ſo a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which is not by other men, a ſelf-teaching, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 21. and a natures teaching, 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 11. 14. yea there are Satanical teachings which are not by men.</p>
               <p>3. When the Scripture uſeth a disjoyning word (as here it doth) the things ſpoken of are diſtinct, unleſſe where cogent reaſons enforce the contrary: and what a weak argument then is it to prove teaching an act of authority, when theſe are disjoyned with an <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> in the very Text that is produced for the proof of it, <hi>viz. 1. Tim.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
               <p>Ob. 2. <hi>On the one ſide of it, teaching is forbidden, on the other ſide, ſilence is enjoyned, and nothing can be more evident, then that he ſpeakes of that uſurpation of authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which conſiſteth in teaching, and is oppoſed to ſilence.

               <p>2. Many other phraſes are ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but faith, &amp;c. uncircumciſion hath circumciſion on the one ſide, and faith on the other ſide, but will any ſay, that uncircumciſion conſiſteth in circumciſion? no more doth teaching on the one ſide, and ſilence on the other prove uſurpation of authority to conſiſt in teaching. <hi>Mr. Pool</hi> ſpeaketh here with much confidence, but with no evidence.</p>
               <p>Ob. 3. <hi>The man here is not to be underſtood ſingularly for her husband, but indefinitely, for any man; for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle is comparing Sex with Sex, in the general,-it concerns ſuch women as have no husbands; it is authority in a Church affair, that is ſpoken of, Mr.</hi> Pool. pag. 109.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If [the man] here be underſtood indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, [any man] then [the gift] 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10. is to be underſtood indefinitely [any gift] and this anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth what he ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 45. about an indefinite expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>2. If (as he ſaith) the Apoſtle compareth Sex with Sex in the general, then the prohibition belongeth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to women, and ſo it maketh nothing againſt the preaching of gifted men.</p>
               <p>3. The whole ſex is forbidden teaching, but only thoſe that have husbands may be forbidden, this uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of authority, becauſe only they are required to be under that obedience of wives. The promiſe of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in child-bearing mentioned but three verſes after, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 15. doth not concern all women, but onely thoſe that have husbands.</p>
               <p>4. That Church authority is intended, he aſſerteth, but hath not proved.</p>
               <p>5. Women may uſurp authority, though it be not over husbands, or in teaching publickly, and therefore their argument hence is without proof, though the man be not onely her husband, but any man.</p>
               <p>As to what he addeth <hi>(pag.</hi> 109.) it concerneth not
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:116041:105"/>
us, and is ſo far from an improvement of our argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the higheſt, that at the loweſt it will be more concluſive; but ſeeing he hath mentioned it, we ſhall ſay thus much to it.</p>
               <p>It precepts expreſſe be prohibitions by conſequence, as <hi>Mr. Pool</hi> ſaith they are, <hi>(pag.</hi> 98, 99.) then <hi>a pari</hi> exceptions expreſſe are conceſſions by conſequence, and ſo the excepting women in the caſe of teaching or propheſying, 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 12. 1 Cor.</hi> 14. 34. will be an allowance to men that have the gift; we think one is as ſtrong as the other.</p>
               <p>Ob. 4. <hi>A paralel place is</hi> 1 Corin. 14. 34. <hi>to ſpeak i. e. in the Church, is unlawful for thoſe who are in a ſtate of ſubjection, and un-officed perſons are in a ſtate of ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as well as women, Mr.</hi> Pool, pa. 110.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

reproving un-called men for preaching, <hi>Jerem. 23. 21, 22. I ſent them not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To part of our anſwer unto this, he replyeth thus.</p>
               <p>Ob. 1. <hi>This is a little too groſſe to ſay they are by God called to be Prophets, of whom God profeſseth, they run, but he ſent them not. The prophets had no other call then this, or at least this was Gods uſual way of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them, be immediately inſpired them with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary meſſage,</hi> 1 Sam. 3. 20. Mr. Pool. p. 111.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Sending did not make prophets: <hi>Samuel</hi> had a revelation, yet was not ſent to <hi>Eli</hi> to declare it, he was forced to draw it out, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 17. yet <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> was a prophet, as appeareth, <hi>v.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was ſent, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 26. 12. The Lord ſent me to propheſie againſt this houſe, and againſt this City, all the words that ye have heard: yet <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> was a Prophet before this ſending, and not made a Prophet by it; So thoſe 2 <hi>Cron.</hi> 24. 19. were ſent after they were Prophets: So that the Prophets had a new miſſion as often as God commanded them to go with any new meſſage to any people, and were ſo often made Prophets, if ſending were, (as he ſuppoſeth) their call. Therefore Gods profeſſing that they ran and he ſent them not, doth not deny them to be Prophets, becauſe ſending is not the call.</p>
               <p>2. There is a ſending which doth not authorize or give a call to Office (as himſelfe confeſſeth, <hi>p.</hi> 83. 87.) and let him prove that their not being ſent, was their not being authorized to be Prophets, elſe the argument is vain.</p>
               <p>3. Thoſe that were authorized and called by God to be Prophets, ſometimes went with falſe dreames or lyes, and ſo ran without being ſent,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:116041:107"/>
yet when they carried a true meſſage, they were ſent, <hi>Act. 21. v.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>So 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 11. There was an old Prophet, and he Propheſied a lye, pretending it to be the word of the Lord, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. I am a Prophet alſo as thou art, and an Angel ſpake unto me by the word of the Lord, ſaying, bring him back, &amp;c. and this was a lye, as appeareth, <hi>v.</hi> 17. 22. 23.</p>
               <p>Yet this old man was a Prophet truly called of God, <hi>Mr Pool</hi> himſelfe being judge; for he ſaith Gods inſpiring with an extraordinary meſſage, was his call to be a Prophet, and this the good old man had <hi>ver.</hi> 20, 21. as they ſat at table, And the word of the Lord came unto the Prophet that brought him back, &amp;c. Now he had a word from God to declare, and ſo was called to be a Prophet, yet <hi>ver.</hi> 18. he ran without being ſent. So that as a falſe Prophet may carry a truth, ſo a true Prophet may carry a lye.</p>
               <p>We granted <hi>(Preacher Sent, pag.</hi> 128.) that thoſe <hi>Jerem.</hi> 23. were falſe Prophets in reſpect of their doctrine which they then preached, but we ſtill apprehend that they were ſtanding Prophets of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and true Prophets in reſpect of their call, and we proved it from <hi>v.</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>4. As to 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 20. it doth not in the leaſt intimate that Gods ſending a meſſage by <hi>Samuel</hi> was his authorization or call to be a Prophet, but only that the anſwering his meſſage by the event did give a knowledge, (which the fruits and effects of a call may do) that he was authorized and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; the words are plain, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. 23. The Lord did let none of his words fall to the ground, and all <hi>Iſrael</hi> [knew] that <hi>Samuel</hi> was eſtabliſhed to be a Prophet of the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:116041:107"/>
5. If they were not extraordinary, yet they might be ordinary Prophets: In old Teſtament times there were two ſorts of Prophets; ſome that had an immediate extraordinary call to foretell things to come, as <hi>Iſaiah, Jeremiah,</hi> &amp;c. others that were inſtructed in the Scooles under the diſcipline of other Prophets, whence they are called Sons of the Prophets, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. 7. and 6. <hi>v.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Theſe had a faculty with dexterity to interpret Scriptures, and explain propheſies, and a call to do it, and a word from the Lord, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. 35.</p>
               <p>Some of theſe might pretend to immediate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, when they had them not, and therein might run before they were ſent; yet might be ſent to do the worke of ordinary Prophets: and their being joyned with the Prieſts in the ſame reproof, under the name of prophets, <hi>Jer. 23. v.</hi> 11. 33, 34. ſpeaks much for their being Gods prophets, as well as the other were his Prieſts, though both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſad degeneration.</p>
               <p>6. If they had no call of God, yet the argument is invalid, and cannot ſpeak againſt gifted mens preaching, ſeeing they (as we have proved) have a call to preach.</p>
               <p>To our argument from <hi>v.</hi> 22. he ſaith,</p>
               <p>Ob. 2. <hi>The ſtanding in Gods counſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and ſpeaking Gods word implies a call. There is another reading ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conformable to the Hebrew text, If they had ſtood in my counſel, i. e. If they had ſtood till I had ſent them, &amp;c. So that this is an evidence that they were falſe prophets,</hi> Mr Pool, pag. 112.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It doth not in the leaſt imply ſuch a Cal as they could not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets without; for thoſe that were <note place="margin">2 <hi>Chro. 24. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:116041:108"/>
ſtand in Gods counſel, &amp;c. in every new meſſage from him; and did ſometimes (as we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) propheſie lyes, and therein they did not ſtand in his counſel, or cauſe to hear his words; and ſo all that is here ſaid in ſuch caſes might be ſpoken to true Prophets; and therefore can be no evidence, (as he would have it) that theſe were falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in reſpect of their call.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> doth not at all favour ſuch a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as he ſpeaketh of; the word doth not ſignifie miſſion, but counſel or ſecret, as <hi>Gen. 49. 6. O my ſoul, come not thou into their ſecret.</hi> It were ſtrange language to ſay come not into their miſſion, and as ſtrange to ſay if they had ſtood in my miſſion, but if they had ſtood in my counſel, or ſecret, is conſonant to the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and it is explained in the following words, &amp; had cauſed to hear my words; which plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intimateth, that their not declaring his words, but lies, as <hi>v.</hi> 25. their broaching falſe doctrine not their want of a true call is that they are blamed for.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who (by Gods own Teſtimony) might have had ſucceſſe and a divine bleſſing in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods word, they might lawfully preach his word; for let any prove that God hath entayled his bleſſing upon the labours of ſuch as (in reſpect of their call) are falſe Prophets.</p>
               <p>2. But the Prophets <hi>Jerem.</hi> 23. (by Gods own Teſtimony) might have had ſucceſſe and a divine bleſſing in preaching Gods word, for its ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. If they had cauſed my people to hear my words, then they ſhould have turned them from their evil way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Prophets, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 23. might lawfully preach Gods word.</p>

                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 7. To what he ſaith for vindicating their ſeventh Argument, we anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. He conſoundeth miſſion and a Call, which are things diſtinct.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The queſtion even in their own ſtating of it, is about a particular Call; for, they aſſert Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be a Call, and their propoſition, which all theſe Arguments are brought to prove, is this, That none may do the work of the Miniſtry without Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination.</p>
               <p>So that if their Arguments prove the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of a Call, yet if they prove not the neceſſity of Ordination unto all ordinary Preaching (which the preſent Argument doth not) they do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude their queſtion; and it is anſwer ſufficient to ſay, Gifted men have a Call to Preach, though they be without Ordination; we do not ſay, that they have no other Call but their gifts, (as he reporteth, <hi>pag.</hi> 112.) it is by the Law of nature and the written word that gifted men are called.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Pauls</hi> immediate Call was a neceſſary, though not the onely <hi>medium</hi> to prove the Divineneſs of his Doctrine; ordinary Officers then and now have other <hi>mediums</hi> to prove it by.</p>

               <p>Object. <hi>All gifted men (though preaching) cannot challenge maintenance, therefore they are no Scripture Preachers, Mr.</hi> Pool, pag. 114.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:116041:109"/>
2. Gifted men may in ſome caſes require maintenance, and do juſtly receive it; yet not as they are gifted men, but as they are imployed in the work, and maintenance is due for the works ſake, as himſelf ſaith, <hi>(pag.</hi> 115.) and is clear, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 7.</p>
               <p>3. Duties of a general calling are ſo to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched and done, as a particular calling be not prejudiced thereby: he will grant that every man is to follow after knowledge, hear Sermons, &amp;c. Yet a man may ſin in doing ſo, if he neglecteth his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, charge or family; rich men therefore are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der further engagements unto this, then poor men, ſingle perſons, then marryed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 34.</p>
               <p>Gifted men may Preach as often as (with due pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration) they can, without neglecting their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular callings, and when gifted mens preaching is onely occaſional, and ſo as a particular calling (which affordeth them a livelihood) is not preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced thereby, then there is not that reaſon for their challenging maintenance, as when ſuch a calling is laid aſide in order thereto, and the work becometh conſtant work; for preaching, when it is onely oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally, is a work of their general calling, and neither the Law of nature, nor the written word (which make it ſo) do require their doing that work any oftner then is conſiſtent with that particular cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling which the outward ſupport of themſelves and families hath dependance upon. Thus much ſhall ſuffice to ſhew the weakneſs of their Arguments againſt gifted mens preaching without Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THere are three Scriptures chiefly urged, to prove the power of Election to belong to a Church, <hi>viz. Act. 1. Act</hi> 6. and <hi>Act.</hi> 14.</p>

               <p>Object. <hi>It was not an exhortation to chuſe, nor a direction in chuſing (here is not a word of the piety, &amp;c. of the perſon) but onely a declaration that one muſt be choſen, &amp;c. however it was fit the people ſhould conſent,</hi> pag. 120.</p>

Object. 1. <hi>Regulation by dead Lawes and rules is no prejudice to the peoples ſole power in Election, but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation by living Judges doth deſtroy it. If the Apoſtles had refuſed any of thoſe choſen by the people upon juſt grounds, would they have been Deacons? if not, then the Eſſence of the Call conſiſts not in Election.

for, their approbation or Ordination might be onely <hi>Cauſa ſine qua non;</hi> they might not be Eſſential, though they could not be without them.</p>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe ſecond queſtion is, whether the Eſſence of a Call to Office lie in Election or Ordination? We prove it to be in Election; our firſt Argument is grounded upon <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 23. and is vindicated al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
               <p>That the Eſſence of the Call lies not in Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we prove divers wayes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 1. Ordination doth not ſet a man over a Church, <hi>Ergo,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Object. 1. <hi>This is but a begging the queſtion,</hi> pag. 131.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> There is not a word of ſetting over a Church by Ordination in the queſtion. Its an apt <hi>medium,</hi> that which giveth the Eſſence of the Call doth ſet over a Church. Ordination doth not ſet over a Church, for. 1. A man may be ordained and yet be over no Church at all. 2. If it did, then there muſt be an iteration of Ordination, both theſe we proved, <hi>Preacher Sent, pag.</hi> 246. 247. &amp;c. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Ordination doth not give the Eſſence o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Call.</p>
               <p>Obj. 2. <hi>Election may be neceſſary as the</hi> cauſa ſine q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a non, <hi>and yet Ordination may be the</hi> cauſa formalis <hi>of the Call,</hi> pag. 131.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That which maketh a Superiour and inferiour is the <hi>Cauſa formalis</hi> of Office-power; and that which ſetteth over a Church doth ſo, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt needs be more then a <hi>cauſa ſine qua non,</hi> even the <hi>cauſe formalis</hi> of Office-power.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:116041:112"/>
That which ſetteth a man over a woman, as her head, is the <hi>cauſa formalis</hi> of the conjugall relation, That which ſetteth over ſervants, is the <hi>cauſa for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malis</hi> of the relation of a Maſter. So here</p>
               <p>2. His inſtances cannot help him.</p>
               <p>To that of preſentation we ſay, 1. The <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of Chriſt empowereth a Church to Elect, without ſubmiſſion unto other men.</p>
               <p>2. In ſuch a caſe, the eſſence is conveyed in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, the Gentle-mans approbation or repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is only <hi>a cauſa, ſine qua non exercitii.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The inſtance is impertinent, becauſe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not a call to office, but a civil call.</p>
               <p>As to that of Arch-Biſhops, it is a begging the queſtion, that his call did lye in conſecration; the King did write to certain Biſhops to confirme the Election; now confirmation followeth creation, nor can the eſſence of the call be in it.</p>
               <p>Ob. 3. <hi>His ordination ſets him over a Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely, his Election ſets him over this or that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church,</hi> pag. 132.</p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. Three arguments we give againſt this, <hi>Preacher Sent. pag.</hi> 248, 249. which are unanſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>2. We would know which ſetting over giveth the call to exerciſe office-power; that which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth <hi>operari,</hi> giveth <hi>eſſe,</hi> man can challinge neither audience, nor maintenance, untill a call to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe.</p>
               <p>It is a ſtrange paradox, that one ſhould be ſet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Catholike Church, when yet he may juſtly be denyed a liberty to exercrſe office-power in any particular Church.</p>
               <p>3. His inſtance of a Dr. of Phyſick is imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; Phyſitians are not Rulers, are not over any by a choice or otherwiſe, neither is there a parity
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:116041:113"/>
between Academical and Eccleſiaſtical preferments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. Our ſecond argument is from ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation being conſequential to a mans having the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the call to Office, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 2, 3.</p>
               <p>Ob. 1. <hi>There is an Ordination</hi> ad munus, <hi>to an Office, and another</hi> ad opus <hi>to a work; this text ſpeaks of ordination to a work,</hi> pag. 132.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We believe that the Apoſtles had no ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to office, but onely to Office-work; and therefore his ordination which came after, did not give his call to Office, no more doth it give it to any Goſpel Officers in a proper ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Ob. 2. <hi>They <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aſsert that the eſſence of the call lyes in election; and to urge this, they urge the Election of an Apoſtle,</hi> Acts 1. <hi>as in that Election, ſo in this ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſome thing was extraordinary, and peculiar to the Apoſtles,</hi> viz. <hi>That the eſsence of their call did not lye in this ordination.</hi> pag 133.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is a groſſe miſtake, for we do not (as he injuriouſly reporteth) urge the election of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. to prove that the eſſence of the call lyes in Election; we plainly deny it, <hi>Preacher Sent. pag.</hi> 267, 268. though we improve their objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from that Text againſt themſelves.</p>
               <p>It is to prove another propoſition that we urge <hi>Acts 1. viz.</hi> That the power of Election belongeth to a Church, <hi>Preacher Sent. pag.</hi> 216. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Mr. Pools</hi> argument, <hi>(pag.</hi> 133) is nothing to us.</p>
               <p>2. That it can be no good plea in this caſe to ſay, it was extraordinory in that particular, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>Preacher Sent. pag.</hi> 252. &amp;c. 255, 256. and that it ſhould be a compleat ordination in all the Acts and requiſites belonging to it, and yet not attain the main end, which (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e ſuppoſeth) is, the giving the eſſence of a call to Office, who will believe it?
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:116041:113"/>
The Apoſtle needeth not ordination, if the uſe of that had been to give the eſſence of a call.</p>
               <p>3. This clearly proveth that a call to Office and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination are ſeparable: a call may be (as here) before, and yet a compleat ordination in all its Acts come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, and therefore the intendment of Ordination, is not to give the eſſence unto a call to Office.</p>
               <p>Ob. 5. <hi>Peradventure</hi> Paul <hi>had the eſſence of his call from his ordination; men were uſed as inſtruments, yet to ſpeak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly it was not men but God that was</hi> Pauls <hi>ordainer, for the Holy Ghost ſaid, ſeparate me, &amp;c.</hi> pag. 135.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. This is groſſe, for <hi>Paul</hi> was an Apoſtle divers yeares before this Ordination; that was after he had been at <hi>Jeruſalem, Acts</hi> 12. 25. and 13. <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. But God had revealed Chriſt in him, and made him an Apoſtle above three years before that, <hi>Gal. 1. ver.</hi> 16, 17.</p>
               <p>2. The Holy Ghoſt ſaying, <hi>ſeperate me, Barnabas and Saul,</hi> &amp;c. was a command to men to ordain, and ſo (though the call were immediate, yet) men were as properly ordainers, as they are in theſe daies, <hi>Acts 8. ver. 29. The ſpirit ſaid unto</hi> Philip, <hi>go near, and joyne thy ſelfe to this Charet.</hi> He may as well ſay that properly it was not <hi>Philip,</hi> but God that did go near and Joyned to the Charet, becauſe the ſpirit ſaid go, &amp;c. or as <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 19. he might ſay, it was God that was to ariſe, &amp; go down, &amp; not <hi>Peter</hi> properly, becauſe the ſpirit ſaid, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, &amp;c. as he may ſay, That properly God was theordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Paul,</hi> becauſe the holy Ghoſt ſaid ſeperate me, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Arg. 3. Our third argument is taken from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Ordination, it conſiſts in prayer, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ob. 1. <hi>If the eſsence of the call did conſiſt in Election, and prayer be uſed before Election, how can they pray in faith, &amp;c.</hi> pag, 135.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Prayer before Election is for the Churches direction into a right choice, and ſo may be in faith, though it be uncertain whether the perſon ſhall be
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:116041:114"/>
choſen or not: but prayer in ordination is for a bleſſing upon a man in a work, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.. 2, 3. and ſo a knowledge that a man is called to it (which preſuppoſeth his having the Eſſence of a call) is neceſſary unto praying in faith there.</p>
               <p>Ob. 2. <hi>In ſuch caſes our prayers have ae</hi> facit <hi>condition, that God would bleſſe him in the work, if he ſhall be ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for it, pag.</hi> 135.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Prayer in ordination is the very act by which a perſon is ſet apart, and therefore there can be no ſuch <hi>facit</hi> condition admitted of here. If he ſhall be ſet apart, implyeth uncertainety whether he ſhall or no, whereas in due Ordination it is alwaies certaine, for the ſetting apart is by prayer.</p>
               <p>Ob. 3. <hi>Ordination conſiſts not in fasting nor prayer, nor lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of hands, but in the deſignation of fit perſons by officers unto the work ſignified by impoſition of hands, and introduced with faſting and prayer, p.</hi> 135.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. That there is a ſeparation of an officer to his work in ordination, we granted, <hi>(preacher Sent. p.</hi> 258.) but the Eſſential act by which that ſeparation is made, is prayer; himſelfe ſaith <hi>(pag.</hi> 135.) impoſition of hands is ſuch, as ordination is not null without it, and he will ſay as much for faſting; and then prayer is the eſſentiall act, or nothing.</p>
               <p>2. No Scripture doth evidence that the eſſence of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination conſiſteth in any deſignation to work, which is a conſtitutive office-making act, neither hath prayer or any other thing which belongs to ordination a tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to produce ſuch an effect as our argument proved.</p>
               <p>He uſeth one argument to prove that the eſſence of the call doth not lye in the Election of the people.</p>
               <p>Ob. <hi>The people neither are, nor by divine appointment are neceſsarily required to be in a capacity to give the eſſence of the call to the Miniſtry; for, 1. They have no authority 2. They have not ability to judge of a mans fitneſs. &amp;c. Mr.</hi> Pool, pag. 136. <hi>to</hi> 141.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:116041:114"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The people are in a capacity to give the eſſence of the call.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The people have as much authority as is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to their giving the eſſence of the call; for, nothing is required thereunto, but a putting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into ſubjection to a perſon duely qualified, it being a voluntary, not a natural relation; and this is done by election with acception, for we proved before, that theſe do ſet a man over a Church. He ſaith they have no authority, becauſe in a ſtate of ſubjection, <hi>pag.</hi> 139. but he anſwereth himſelfe by his inſtance, <hi>pag.</hi> 138. For, in Democratical governement, the people are in ſubjection civilly unto thoſe very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers to whom they give a call, yet have authority to call them; are leſſer and yet greater then their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers though women were preſent, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not, that they did give their ſuffrage; they will allow women to be preſent at an Ordination, when they act not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The people have ability to judge of a mans fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for the Miniſtry: it cannot be denyed that <hi>Iohn</hi> did write to the people, 1 <hi>Ioh. 2. ver. 12. I writ unto you little children,</hi> ſo they are called, little children, <hi>v.</hi> 13. 18 28. and 1 <hi>Ioh. 3. ver.</hi> 7. and yet theſe little children are commanded to try the ſpirits, 1 <hi>Ioh. 4. ver.</hi> 1. Beloved, believe not every ſpirit, but try the Spirits whether they are of God, becauſe many falſe Prophets are gone out into the world. This neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppoſeth them in a capacity to judge whether they were falſe Prophets or not; for it had been in vain to bid them try, if they could not draw up a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the tryal. If they be not fit to judge unto a choice, they are not fit to judge of the doctrine of him that is choſen, and ſo muſt take all upon impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit faith: and ſtill the ſame perſons are written to, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. and both that appellation, and alſo the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:116041:115"/>
of the Epiſtle is ſuch as concerneth all believers, and ſo cannot be reſtrained to Officers.</p>
               <p>Alſo, the people have ſometimes judged right when the Rulers have condemned them for it, and taken a contrary part, undervaluing and contemning their judgement, <hi>Iohn 7. ver.</hi> 48. 49.</p>
               <p>They grant that the peoples election maketh a man their Miniſter; we ask whether they ſee with their own eyes therein? It is evident that many inſufficient ones are ordained. It is not a careleſs people we plead for, but <hi>Bereans;</hi> and all that are godly, that are believers, &amp; fit to be admitted Church members, are fit (with the reſt of the Church) to judge of a Miniſters abilities, which anſwereth what he ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 141. about its being a neceſſary qualification in every Church-member. If one Church-member could not judge of it, yet all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether have ability. Some arguments againſt election, as giving the eſſence of the call, he ſeeketh to vindicate.</p>
               <p>Ob. 1. <hi>As to</hi> Acts 6. <hi>the Apoſtles are ſaid</hi>

               <p>The ſetting in order things that were wanting, is expreſly and firſtly mentioned as the cauſe of <hi>Titus</hi> his ſtaying at <hi>Crete,</hi> and as that concerned but the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being of the Church, no more did ordaining of Elders in every City; for Churches have a being before Officers, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. and if <hi>Titus</hi> himſelfe had acted in neither of theſe works, but onely had taken the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ſight of thoſe Churches, and directed them therein, yet it would have been neceſſary enough, (eſpecially in that Infant ſtate of the Church) that <hi>Titus</hi> ſhould a bide at <hi>Crete,</hi> but doubtleſſe he had preaching work e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough there which was greater then his ordaining <hi>Elders.</hi>

               <p>2. The power of <hi>Moſes</hi> was Supream, all other powers ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate unto him, the power of ſpiritual officers not ſo.</p>

               <p>That freemen in a Corporation give the Eſſentials of a Call to their Officers &amp;c. is enough to ſhew that ſuch as have no Office-power, yet frequently do make Officers, which anſwereth the Provinc.

               <p>3. It is a ſtirring up as fire, and its very improper to ſay that office is ſo ſtirred up, eſpecially ſeeing the gift is ſaid to be in him, which is not true of office. Though a man may be ſaid to be in that which is in him, as being ſwallowed up or overcome thereby, as a man in ſin, in bear or drink, in joy, &amp;c. Yet it cannot (with any propriety of ſpeech) be ſaid, that is in a man which is but upon him: office is onely adherent to a man, not inherent or in him; it were very improper to ſay to a Major, Bayliffe, Juſtice, Conſtable, &amp;c. ſtir up the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice that is [in you.]</p>
               <p>4. If an extraordinary Office might be conveyed by ordinary Officers (which is not proved) yet their Argument is of no force, unleſs he can prove, that it was done here; what he addeth <hi>(pag.</hi> 149) of its being ordinary in ſtate and Church for a Perſon to have an Office conveyed to him Miniſterially, by ſuch as are inferiour to him, &amp;c. doth plainly contradict what himſelf ſaid, <hi>p.</hi> 138. 160.

the greater; and by this Rule, though the people be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to their Officers, yet they may convey their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to them. His inſtance of a King whoſe Office is conveyed by ſome of his Subjects (if true) proveth that thoſe who are placed in a ſtate of ſubjection, yet may have authority enough to give the Eſſence to their Officers, and ſo anſwereth what he ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 139.</p>

               <p>It is a feeble Argument that cannot ſtand unleſs there be a receding from the uſual ſignification of divers words, and a plain ſenſe of the Texts alleadged for it.</p>
               <p>And himſelf can find their argument to amount but to an [it may be] and ſo we may retort upon him, what he groundleſly ſaith to us, <hi>pag.</hi> 126. all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it deſerves is [it may not be;] he ſhould not onely have ſhewed, that <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 1. Elſe Ordination were unattainable; for there is not one precept nor preſident of an ordinary officers acting in Ordination out of the particular Church he is over.</p>
               <p>Ob. 1. <hi>There are divers practices lawfully uſed which yet we find no preſident for, but ſuch as extraordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are concerned in, as excommunication, Mr.</hi> Pool, p. 153.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If there be a precept for ſuch practices (as there was for excommunication, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.) we do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a preſident; our Argument was from the want both of precept and preſident.</p>
               <p>Ob. 2. <hi>It is againſt them, if what they ſay be true, then there is neither precept nor preſident for the ordaining of officers, Mr.</hi> Pool, pag. 153.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is a great miſtake alſo; for, we did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that an ordinary officer hath precept or preſident for acting in Ordination in the Church he is over, but that any of the Texts alleadged for Ordination do warrant his ordaining out of the particular Church he is over, this is it which we deny; and ſo if a Church wanteth officers, then thoſe Texts warrant none in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining, and other general Rules authorize no officers

                  </gap> And this anſwereth alſo what he addeth <hi>(pag.</hi> 153. 154.) we grant that ſome acts of extraordinary officers are preſidents for us, but not ſuch acts as are of an extraordinary nature, or did flow from an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary power. In the act it ſelf of ordaining, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles are preſidents for us, but if Ordination was upon the hands of Apoſtles Miniſterially in every Church, yet it doth not follow it ought to be ſo on the hand of every Miniſter; in this the Apoſtles are not preſidents, becauſe they were Elders in every Church, ſo are not ordinary officers as we have proved. That the proper Elders of every Church ſhould carry on the work in their own Churches, is according to the preſident, but it reacheth no further.</p>
               <p>Ob: 3. <hi>For,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 14. <hi>we read nothing of them which was extraordinary, Mr.</hi> Pool, pag. 154.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Its very probable it was an extraordinary Presbytery; For, there is not a word to evidence it to conſiſt of ordinary perſons, Apoſtles were Presbyters, 1 <hi>Pet. 5. 1. 2. Joh.</hi> 1. and <hi>Paul</hi> one of the Presbytery, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6. we proved before that no office was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. and if it were onely an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary gift, no ordinary Presbytery could convey that; himſelf ſaith the power of conferring ſuch gifts was the priviledge of Apoſtles and extraordinary officers, <hi>p.</hi> 150. he that will conclude it an ordinary Presbytery, muſt argue, <hi>a genere ad ſpeciem affirmative,</hi> and ſay, it was a Presbytery, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it was an ordinary one.</p>
               <p>2. If it were an ordinary Presbytery (which yet is not granted, the Call to lay on hands was extraordinary, by Propheſie, as themſelves confeſs, <hi>Jus Div. Min. p.</hi> 167. and this is enough to our preſent Argument.</p>

one, and not for the other, then they may do the one and not the other, Mr.</hi> Pool, pag. 155.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Nay there is not a word in Scripture for an ordinary officers acting in Ordination out of the particular Church he is over upon an ordinary Call, and ſo the Scriptures ſilence is as much argumentative (in caſe a Church hath no officers in it) againſt Ordination by officers of other Churches (our officers) as againſt Ordination by the people.</p>
               <p>Object. 2. <hi>There is the ſame reaſon for the Apoſtles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a preſident for Miniſters baptizing and not the people, and for their ordaining and not the people,</hi> pag. 158.</p>

               <p>2. We never find Ordination by ordinary officers upon an ordinary Call out of the Churches they are over, and ſo the caſe is as difficult on his part, as on ours.</p>
               <p>His laſt Argument <hi>(p. 160. viz.</hi> That Ordination is that act which conſtitutes a man in office, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed before. And thus we have finiſhed our reply to the chief matters in his book; onely for a concluſion he accuſeth us to the Reader.</p>

               </list>
               <p n="1">1. As to his liſt of novel &amp; ſtrang paſſages, we anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our words <hi>(pag.</hi> 13.) do not ſo much as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly deny Jeſus Chriſt to have preached to the Jewes as a Teacher by office: That Text <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 54. 57. was alledged onely to evidence that ſtumblers at and oppoſers of the word, in reſpect of him that teacheth, may be ſaid to be taught; this is all we produce it for, as any Reader may ſee; and this it clearly proveth, that no meer man can be an officer to ſuch, we prove, but it is by other <hi>mediums,</hi> not by that Text, neither can any inferrence be drawn from our words againſt Chriſts being an Officer to ſuch, eſpecially ſeeing Chriſt was an extraordinary perſon, even the Law-maker and determiner who men ſhould be Officers to.</p>
               <p>As to the Apoſtles, in a large ſenſe they were offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to heathens, but not Officers over them, or in a ſtrict ſenſe, as we have ſhewn in this book, <hi>Ch.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:116041:120"/>
2. The ſecond we own, if the reſt of our words be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to it, neither hath he diſproved it, we would know from whom <hi>Apollo</hi> had a probation before his preaching?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third is proved in the pages he quoteth, and alſo in this book, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>Let him evidence that an outward call from man is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny where in Scripture ſtiled a miſſion or ſending, or that any but God doth ſend in the ſenſe we take it in there.</p>
               <p>We do not deny, that a Church is to give a Call to Office, but we deny that ſending is that call.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth we own, neither hath he diſproved it; and the ſame we ſay to the ſixt and ſeventh.</p>
               <p>As to the fiſt about adminiſtring the Sacraments not as Paſtors; we deſire the Reader would view our former book, <hi>pag.</hi> 280. and this book. <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>As to the eight &amp; ninth, we have ſpoken to them, <hi>Ch.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to his accuſation for ſelfe-contradicting paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, we anſwer. 1. We can find nothing like a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in our words, if <hi>pag.</hi> 20, and 149. be compared.</p>
               <p>For if a man may lawfully preach, yet may there not be divers things pre-required unto his preaching here or there.</p>
               <p>May not a man have power to preach, and yet want requiſites unto the exerciſe of that power, in this or that place? do not they ſay, a man may have power, and yet without the conſent of ſome, or a ſpecial call, may not exerciſe that power in ſuch a place, <hi>Jus Div. Min. pag.</hi> 144? Doth not <hi>Mr. Pool</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly aſſert it, <hi>pag.</hi> 6.? Yea he ſaith <hi>(pag.</hi> 48.) It is true; no preachers are in Scripture oblidged to preach in ſuch or ſuch a place, &amp;c. what do we ſay more; We may turne his words <hi>(pag.</hi> 163.) upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, &amp; ſay, how can a man preach, but he muſt preach in this or that place? <hi>quod nuſquam fit non fit.</hi> So that the contradiction (if it be one) is as much his, as ours.</p>
               <p>2 It is his groſſe miſtake to ſay that we are guilty of ſelfe-contradiction in the other two particulars
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:116041:120"/>
which he mentioneth, <hi>pag.</hi> 163. For, what he rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth out of our book, <hi>pag.</hi> 300. to make one part of the contradiction, is an objection of theirs, they are not our words, but the words of the provincial aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, <hi>Jus. Divin. Min. pag.</hi> 133.</p>
               <p>And that which he maketh the other part of the contradiction, is our anſwer to the aforeſaid objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and ſo, we do but oppoſe them <hi>(pag.</hi> 302. not contradict our ſelves. They are their words from, <hi>p. 300. l. 21.</hi> to <hi>p. 301. lin.</hi> 14. &amp; this he might eaſily have ſeen though it be not printed in a different Character.</p>
               <p>And now we ſhall put <hi>Mr. Pool</hi> in mind of ſome of his, 1. novel and ſtrange paſſages.</p>
               <p>2. Selfe-contradictions.</p>
               <p>3. Repugnancies, to the provincial Aſſembly, whoſe caſe he pleadeth, &amp; the Dr. 1. novel &amp; ſtrange paſſages.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He ſaith, that a Miniſter may be a Miniſter, though he have no particular Church to which he ſtands rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>p.</hi> 11. &amp; by Miniſter he intends an officer, <hi>pag.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſaith that heathens are a part of Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <hi>pag.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>And therefore are the object and correlate of the Paſtoral office, <hi>ib.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. He ſaith of an excomunicate perſon, that while he repents not, he is to be looked upon after a ſort as an unbaptized perſon, or as an heathen; yet when he doth repent, he needs no new baptiſm, foraſmuch as God is pleaſed to impute to him his former baptiſm. <hi>pa.</hi> 27.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He ſaith that the difference between <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> and <hi>paſtoral</hi> power lyes not in the extent of their relation <hi>pa.</hi> 36.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He ſaith, <hi>Vzzah</hi> was puniſhed not principally, at leaſt not ſolely becauſe he did touch the Ark with his heads, but becauſe he did not bear it upon his ſhoulders, <hi>pag.</hi> 99. which is againſt 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13. 10.</p>
